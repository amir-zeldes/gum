61	Wikinews	(3)

77	[	_
78	The	(8
79	Spitfire	_
80	Tournament	_
81	in	_
82	Canada	8)
83	]	_
84	was	_
85	a	_
86	really	_
87	good	_
88	tournament	_
89	actually	_
90	.	_
91	It	(8)
92	was	_
93	a	_
94	tournament	_
95	that	_
96	I	(4)
97	wish	_
98	we	(5)
99	'd	_
100	actually	_
101	gone	_
102	back	_
103	to	_
104	more	_
105	often	_
106	.	_
107	Who	_
108	plays	_
109	in	_
110	that	(8
111	one	8)
112	?	_
113	It	(8)
114	's	_
115	quite	_
116	a	_
117	large	_
118	Canadian	_
119	tournament	_
120	,	_
121	and	_
122	so	_
123	we	(5)
124	went	_
125	as	_
126	the	(5
127	Gliders	_
128	team	5)
129	.	_
130	So	_
131	we	(5)
132	were	_
133	trying	_
134	to	_
135	get	_
136	as	_
137	many	_
138	international	_
139	games	_
140	as	_
141	possible	_
142	.	_
143	Cause	_
144	that	_
145	's	_
146	one	_
147	of	_
148	our	(5)
149	problems	_
150	really	_
151	,	_
152	to	_
153	compete	_
154	.	_
155	It	_
156	costs	_
157	us	(5)
158	so	_
159	much	_
160	money	_
161	to	_
162	for	_
163	us	_
164	to	_
165	travel	_
166	overseas	_
167	and	_
168	to	_
169	compete	_
170	internationally	_
171	.	_
172	And	_
173	so	_
174	we	(5)
175	can	_
176	compete	(9)
177	against	_
178	each	(10
179	other	10)
180	all	_
181	the	_
182	time	_
183	within	_
184	Australia	(2)
185	but	_
186	we	(10)
187	really	_
188	need	_
189	to	_
190	be	_
191	able	_
192	to	_
193	...	_
194	It	(9)
195	's	_
196	not	_
197	the	_
198	same	_
199	.	_
200	No	_
201	,	_
202	it	(9)
203	's	_
204	really	_
205	not	_
206	,	_
207	so	_
208	it	_
209	's	_
210	really	_
211	important	_
212	to	_
213	be	_
214	able	_
215	to	_
216	get	_
217	as	_
218	a	_
219	many	_
220	international	_
221	trips	_
222	throughout	_
223	the	_
224	year	_
225	to	_
226	continue	_
227	our	(10)
228	improvement	_
229	.	_
230	Also	_
231	see	_
232	where	_
233	all	_
234	the	_
235	other	_
236	teams	_
237	are	_
238	at	_
239	as	_
240	well	_
241	.	_
242	But	_
243	yes	_
244	,	_
245	Spitfire	(8)
246	was	_
247	good	_
248	.	_
249	We	(10)
250	took	_
251	quite	_
252	a	_
253	few	_
254	new	_
255	girls	_
256	over	_
257	there	(8)
258	back	_
259	then	_
260	in	_
261	2005	_
262	,	_
263	leading	_
264	into	_
265	the	(11
266	World	_
267	Cup	_
268	in	_
269	the	_
270	Netherlands	11)
271	.	_
272	Was	_
273	that	(11)
274	the	(12
275	one	_
276	where	_
277	you	(4)
278	were	_
279	the	_

281	of	_
282	the	(10
283	team	10)
284	,	_
285	in	_
286	2005	12)
287	?	_
288	Or	_
289	was	_
290	that	(12)
291	a	_
292	later	_
293	one	_
294	?	_
295	No	_
296	,	_
297	I	(4)
298	captained	_
299	in	_
300	2010	_
301	.	_
302	So	_
303	2009	_
304	,	_
305	2010	_
306	World	_
307	Cup	_
308	.	_
309	And	_
310	then	_
311	I	(4)
312	had	_
313	a	_
314	bit	_
315	of	_
316	some	_
317	time	_
318	off	_
319	in	_
320	2011	_
321	.	_
322	The	(10
323	Gliders	10)
324	have	_
325	never	_
326	won	_
327	the	(13
328	World	_
329	Championship	13)
330	.	_
331	We	(10)
332	always	_
333	seem	(14)
334	to	_
335	have	_
336	just	_
337	a	_
338	little	_
339	bit	_
340	of	_
341	a	_
342	chill	_
343	out	_
344	at	_
345	the	(13
346	World	_
347	Cup	13)
348	.	_
349	I	(4)
350	do	_
351	n't	_
352	know	_
353	why	_
354	.	_
355	It	(14)
356	's	_
357	really	_
358	strange	_
359	occurrence	_
360	,	_
361	over	_
362	the	_
363	years	_
364	.	_
365	2002	_
366	World	_
367	Cup	_
368	,	_
369	we	(10)
370	won	_
371	bronze	_
372	.	_
373	Then	_
374	in	_
375	2006	_
376	we	(10)
377	ended	_
378	up	_
379	fourth	_
380	.	_
381	It	_
382	was	_
383	one	_
384	of	_
385	the	_
386	worst	_
387	World	_
388	Cups	_
389	we	(10)
390	've	_
391	played	_
392	actually	_
393	.	_
394	And	_
395	then	_
396	in	_
397	2010	_
398	we	(10)
399	just	_
400	...	_
401	I	(4)
402	do	_
403	n't	_
404	know	_
405	what	_
406	happened	_
407	.	_
408	We	(10)
409	just	_
410	did	_
411	n't	_
412	play	_
413	as	_
414	well	_
415	as	_
416	we	(10)
417	thought	_
418	we	_
419	would	_
420	.	_
421	Came	_
422	fourth	_
423	.	_
424	But	_
425	you	(15)
426	know	_
427	what	_
428	?	_
429	Fired	_
430	us	(10)
431	up	_
432	for	_
433	the	(7
434	actual	_
435	Paralympics	7)
436	.	_
437	So	_
438	the	(13
439	World	_
440	Cup	13)
441	is	_
442	...	_
443	it	_
444	's	_
445	good	_
446	to	_
447	be	(16)
448	able	_
449	to	_
450	do	_
451	well	_
452	at	_
453	the	(13
454	World	_
455	Cup	13)
456	,	_
457	to	_
458	be	_
459	placed	_
460	,	_
461	but	_
462	it	(16)
463	also	_
464	means	_
465	that	_
466	you	(17)
467	get	_
468	a	_
469	really	_
470	good	_
471	opportunity	_
472	to	_
473	know	_
474	where	_
475	you	_
476	're	_
477	at	_
478	in	_
479	that	_
480	two	_
481	year	_
482	gap	_
483	between	_
484	the	(18
485	Paralympics	18)
486	.	_
487	So	_
488	you	(17)
489	can	_
490	come	_
491	back	_
492	home	_
493	and	_
494	revisit	_
495	what	_
496	you	(17)
497	need	_
498	to	_
499	do	_
500	and	_
501	,	_
502	you	(15)
503	know	_
504	,	_
505	where	_
506	the	(10
507	team	10)
508	's	_
509	at	_
510	.	_
511	And	_
512	all	_
513	that	_
514	sort	_
515	of	_
516	stuff	_
517	.	_
518	Unfortunately	_
519	,	_
520	they	_
521	are	_
522	talking	_
523	about	_
524	moving	(19)
525	it	(13)
526	so	_
527	it	(13)
528	will	_
529	be	_
530	on	_
531	the	_
532	year	_
533	before	_
534	the	(18
535	Paralympics	18)
