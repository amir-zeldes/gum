2	Steven	(1)
3	wanted	(2)
4	to	_
5	be	_
6	a	_
7	dentist	_
8	.	_
9	It	(2)
10	was	_
11	pretty	_
12	much	_
13	the	_
14	first	_
15	thing	_
16	he	(1)
17	told	_
18	us	(3)
19	when	_
20	,	_
21	as	_
22	first	_
23	years	_
24	,	_
25	we	(3)
26	were	_
27	all	_
28	bunched	_
29	together	_
30	in	_
31	the	_
32	unfamiliar	_
33	dusty	_
34	classroom	_
35	.	_
36	When	_
37	,	_
38	a	_
39	couple	_
40	of	_
41	weeks	_
42	later	_
43	we	(3)
44	were	_
45	invited	_
46	over	_
47	to	_
48	his	(1)
49	house	_
50	we	(3)
51	saw	_
52	that	_
53	this	(2)
54	was	_
55	not	_
56	an	_
57	idle	_
58	remark	_
59	.	_
60	Where	_
61	our	(3)
62	bedroom	_

64	were	_
65	decorated	_
66	with	_

71	and	_
72	footballers	_

103	,	_
104	teeth	_
105	.	_
106	Where	_
107	we	(3)
108	had	_
109	shelves	_
110	of	_
111	plastic	_
112	dinosaurs	_
113	and	_

116	from	_
117	cornflake	_
118	boxes	_
119	,	_
120	Steven	(1)
121	had	_
122	plaster	(4
123	casts	_
124	of	_
125	jawbones	_
126	,	_
127	gums	_
128	and	_
129	teeth	_
130	grinning	_
131	down	_
132	at	_
133	us	4)(3)
134	.	_
135	The	(5
136	instruments	5)
137	were	_
138	locked	_
139	away	_
140	in	_
141	glass	_
142	cabinets	_
143	and	_
144	only	_
145	his	(6(1)
146	parents	6)
147	had	_
148	the	_
149	key	_

182	too	_
183	expensive	_
184	for	_
185	me	(1)
186	to	_

190	”	_
191	Of	_
192	course	_
193	,	_
194	we	(3)
195	tried	_
196	to	_
197	pick	_
198	the	_
199	locks	_
200	,	_
201	but	_
202	the	(5

211	—	_
212	out	_
213	of	_
214	reach	_
215	.	_
216	We	(3)
217	did	_
218	n’t	_
219	see	_
220	Steven	(1

222	interest	_
223	as	_

225	,	_
226	well	_
227	,	_
228	not	_
229	that	_
230	much	_
231	.	_
232	We	(3
233	all	3)
234	had	_
235	our	(3)

243	collecting	_
244	beer	_
245	caps	_

247	that	_

252	anyone	_
253	else	_
254	.	_
255	DIY	(8
256	Dentistry	8)
257	was	_
258	just	_
259	something	_
260	that	_
261	had	_
262	never	_
263	crossed	_
264	our	(3)
265	horizon	_

344	together	_
345	.	_
346	Besides	_
347	,	_
348	Steven	(1)
349	had	_
350	some	_
351	really	_
352	good	_
353	stuff	_
354	:	_
355	sweets	_
356	that	_
357	stained	_
358	your	(13(14)
359	teeth	13)
360	bright	(15
361	red	15)
362	—	_
363	well	_
364	,	_
365	technically	_
366	,	_
367	not	_
368	your	(13(14)
369	teeth	13)
370	,	_
371	just	_
372	the	_
373	plaque	_
374	,	_
375	but	_
376	the	_
377	result	_
378	was	_
379	often	_
380	the	_
381	same	_
382	.	_
383	It	_
384	took	_
385	a	_
386	few	_
387	days	_
388	good	_
389	brushing	_
390	to	_
391	get	_
392	it	(15)
393	off	_
394	.	_
395	Well	_
396	,	_
397	most	_
398	of	_
399	it	(15)
400	anyway	_
401	.	_
402	He	(1)
403	had	_
404	effervescent	_
405	tablets	_
406	that	_

425	your	(17(14)
426	mouth	17)
427	out	_
428	after	_
429	scraping	_
430	around	_
431	inside	16)

433	and	_
434	guaranteed	_
435	to	_
436	make	_
437	the	(18

439	kids	18)
440	splutter	_
441	and	_
442	spit	_
443	it	(16)
444	out	_
445	when	_
446	the	_
447	taste	_
448	slowly	_
449	percolated	_
450	through	_
451	and	_
452	met	_
453	the	_
454	memory	_
455	of	_
456	their	(18)
457	last	_
458	checkup	_
459	.	_
460	Then	_
461	there	_
462	was	_
463	the	_
464	event	_
465	that	_
466	became	_
467	the	_
468	rite	_
469	of	_
470	passage	_
471	into	_
472	our	(3)
473	group	_
474	of	_
475	misfits	_
476	and	_
477	outcasts	_
478	:	_
479	making	(19)
480	a	(20
481	mould	_
482	of	_
483	your	(13(14)
484	teeth	13)20)
485	.	_
486	It	_
487	was	_
488	inevitable	_
489	that	_
490	one	_
491	of	_
492	us	(3)
493	,	_
494	seeing	_
495	the	(4

497	casts	_
498	on	_
499	the	(21
500	shelf	_
501	by	_
502	Steven	(1
503	’s	1)
504	bed	21)4)
505	would	_
506	ask	_
507	how	_
508	they	(4)
509	were	_
510	done	_
511	.	_
512	It	_
513	was	_
514	just	_
515	as	_
516	inevitable	_
517	that	_
518	a	_
519	few	_
520	minutes	_
521	later	_
522	,	_
523	Steven	(1)
524	would	_
525	be	_
526	mixing	_
527	up	_
528	various	(22
529	powders	_
530	and	_
531	liquids	22)
532	,	_
533	and	_
534	pouring	_
535	them	(22)
536	into	_
537	a	_
538	horse-shoe	_
539	shaped	_
540	contraption	_
541	.	_
542	It	(19)
543	was	_
544	n’t	_
545	dangerous	_
546	.	_
547	At	_
548	least	_
549	,	_
550	I	(10)
551	suppose	_
552	so	_
553	.	_
554	It	(19)
555	was	_
556	vaguely	_
557	uncomfortable	_
558	,	_
559	and	_
560	appeared	_
561	sufficiently	_
562	disturbing	_
563	that	_
564	we	(3)
565	all	_
566	volunteered	_
567	each	(3
568	other	3)
569	in	_
570	turn	_
571	until	_
572	,	_
573	at	_
574	last	_
575	,	_
576	Andy	(9)
577	said	_
578	he	(9)
579	was	_
580	game	_
581	.	_
582	And	_
583	we	(3)
584	were	_
585	off	_
586	.	_
587	The	_
588	hardest	_
589	part	_
590	was	_
591	probably	_
592	to	_
593	overcome	_
594	the	_
595	gagging	_
596	reflex	_
597	that	_
598	set	_
599	in	_
600	when	_
601	you	(14)
602	bit	_
603	down	_
604	into	_
605	the	(23
606	acrid	_
607	resin	_
608	jelly	23)
609	and	_
610	it	(23)
611	flowed	_
612	out	_
613	and	_
614	up	_
615	and	_
616	around	_
617	,	_
618	over	_
619	teeth	_
620	,	_
621	gums	_
622	and	_
623	tongue	_
624	.	_
625	Your	(14)
626	nose	_
627	filled	_
628	with	_
629	what	_
630	you	(14)
631	imagined	_
632	were	_
633	fumes	_
634	from	_
635	the	(23
636	warm	_
637	paste	23)
638	.	_
639	And	_
640	you	(14)
641	seemed	_
642	to	_
643	be	_
644	suddenly	_
645	drowning	_
646	in	_
647	your	(14)
648	own	_
649	saliva	_
650	.	_
651	Things	_
652	generally	_
653	got	_
654	better	_
655	when	_
656	Steven	(1)
657	reminded	_
658	you	(14)
659	that	_
660	you	(14)
661	could	_
662	actually	_
663	breathe	_
664	,	_
665	and	_
666	swallow	_
667	,	_
668	normally	_
669	.	_
670	He	(1)
671	watched	_
672	the	_
673	second	_
674	hand	_
675	trotting	_
676	round	_
677	the	_
678	dial	_
679	of	_
680	his	(1)
681	watch	_
682	mouthing	_
683	the	_
684	quarters	_
685	,	_
686	before	_
687	poking	_
688	the	(23
689	setting	_
690	goo	23)
691	to	_
692	check	_
693	its	(23)
694	consistency	_
695	.	_
696	Then	_
697	,	_
698	when	_
699	he	(1)
700	gave	_
701	you	(14)
702	the	_
703	nod	_
704	,	_
705	you	(14)
706	tried	_
707	to	_
708	prise	_
709	your	(14)
710	jaws	_
711	apart	_
712	.	_
713	As	_
714	the	_
715	seal	_
716	around	_
717	your	(14)
718	gums	_
719	and	_
720	teeth	_
721	was	_
722	pretty	_
723	solid	_
724	,	_
725	you	(14)
726	thought	_
727	it	(20)
728	would	_
729	never	_
730	come	_
731	off	_
732	,	_
733	as	_
734	the	(24
735	others	24)
736	giggled	_
737	at	_
738	your	(14)
739	expressions	_
740	and	_
741	grimaces	_
742	.	_
743	Steven	(1)
744	jiggled	_
745	the	(25
746	handle	_
747	that	_
748	stuck	_
749	out	_
750	beyond	_
751	your	(14)
752	front	_
753	teeth	_
754	like	_
755	some	_
756	metallic	_
757	duck	_
758	’s	_
759	bill	25)
760	,	_
761	turning	_
762	and	_
763	twisting	_
764	it	(25)
765	most	_
766	professionally	_
767	and	_
768	murmuring	_
769	encouragements	_
770	.	_
771	And	_
772	,	_
773	then	_
774	,	_
775	with	_
776	an	_
777	awful	_
778	sucking	_
779	slurp	_
780	,	_
781	it	(20)
782	came	_
783	free	_
784	.	_
785	The	_
