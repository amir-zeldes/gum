4	to	_
5	be	_
6	a	_
7	dentist	_
8	.	_
9	It	(2)
10	was	_
11	pretty	_
12	much	_
13	the	_
14	first	_
15	thing	_
16	he	(1)
17	told	_
18	us	(3)
19	when	_
20	,	_
21	as	_

29	together	_
30	in	_
31	the	_
32	unfamiliar	_
33	dusty	_

40	of	_
41	weeks	_
42	later	_
43	we	(3)

47	to	_
48	his	(1)
49	house	_
50	we	(3)
51	saw	_
52	that	_
53	this	(2)
54	was	_
55	not	_
56	an	_
57	idle	_
58	remark	_
59	.	_
60	Where	_
61	our	(3)

103	,	_
104	teeth	_
105	.	_
106	Where	_
107	we	(3)
108	had	_
109	shelves	_

116	from	_
117	cornflake	_
118	boxes	_
119	,	_
120	Steven	(1)
121	had	_

125	jawbones	_
126	,	_
127	gums	_

129	teeth	_
130	grinning	_
131	down	_
132	at	_
133	us	4)(3)
134	.	_
135	The	(5
136	instruments	5)
137	were	_
138	locked	_
139	away	_
140	in	_
141	glass	_
142	cabinets	_
143	and	_
144	only	_
145	his	(6(1)
146	parents	6)
147	had	_

190	”	_
191	Of	_
192	course	_
193	,	_
194	we	(3)
195	tried	_
196	to	_
197	pick	_
198	the	_
199	locks	_
200	,	_
201	but	_
202	the	(5

226	well	_
227	,	_
228	not	_
229	that	_
230	much	_
231	.	_
232	We	(3

255	DIY	(8
256	Dentistry	8)
257	was	_
258	just	_
259	something	_

350	Besides	_
351	,	_
352	Steven	(1)
353	had	_
354	some	_
355	really	_
356	good	_
357	stuff	_
358	:	_
359	sweets	_
360	that	_
361	stained	_
362	your	(13(14)
363	teeth	13)
364	bright	(15
365	red	15)
366	—	_
367	well	_
368	,	_
369	technically	_
370	,	_
371	not	_
372	your	(13(14)

374	,	_
375	just	_
376	the	_
377	plaque	_
378	,	_
379	but	_
380	the	_
381	result	_
382	was	_
383	often	_
384	the	_
385	same	_
386	.	_
387	It	_
388	took	_
389	a	_
390	few	_
391	days	_
392	good	_
393	brushing	_
394	to	_
395	get	_
396	it	(15)
397	off	_

399	Well	_
400	,	_
401	most	_
402	of	_
403	it	(15)
404	anyway	_
405	.	_
406	He	(1)
407	had	_
408	effervescent	_
409	tablets	_

446	spit	_
447	it	(16)
448	out	_
449	when	_
450	the	_
451	taste	_
452	slowly	_
453	percolated	_
454	through	_
455	and	_

459	of	_
460	their	(18)
461	last	_
462	checkup	_
463	.	_
464	Then	_
465	there	_
466	was	_
467	the	_
468	event	_
469	that	_
470	became	_
471	the	_
472	rite	_
473	of	_
474	passage	_
475	into	_
476	our	(3)
477	group	_
478	of	_
479	misfits	_
480	and	_
481	outcasts	_
482	:	_
483	making	(19)
484	a	(20

486	of	_
487	your	(13(14)
488	teeth	13)20)
489	.	_
490	It	_
491	was	_
492	inevitable	_
493	that	_
494	one	_
495	of	_
496	us	(3)
497	,	_
498	seeing	_
499	the	(4

502	on	_
503	the	(21
504	shelf	_
505	by	_
506	Steven	(1
507	’s	1)
508	bed	21)4)
509	would	_
510	ask	_
511	how	_
512	they	(4)
513	were	_
514	done	_
515	.	_
516	It	_
517	was	_
518	just	_
519	as	_
520	inevitable	_
521	that	_
522	a	_
523	few	_
524	minutes	_
525	later	_
526	,	_
527	Steven	(1)
528	would	_
529	be	_
530	mixing	_
531	up	_
532	various	(22
533	powders	_
534	and	_
535	liquids	22)
536	,	_
537	and	_
538	pouring	_
539	them	(22)
540	into	_
541	a	_
542	horse	_
543	-	_
544	shoe	_
545	shaped	_
546	contraption	_
547	.	_
548	It	(19)
549	was	_
550	n’t	_
551	dangerous	_
552	.	_
553	At	_
554	least	_
555	,	_
556	I	(10)
557	suppose	_
558	so	_
559	.	_
560	It	(19)
561	was	_
562	vaguely	_
563	uncomfortable	_
564	,	_
565	and	_
566	appeared	_
567	sufficiently	_
568	disturbing	_
569	that	_
570	we	(3)
571	all	_
572	volunteered	_
573	each	(3
574	other	3)
575	in	_
576	turn	_
577	until	_
578	,	_
579	at	_
580	last	_
581	,	_
582	Andy	(9)
583	said	_
584	he	(9)
585	was	_
586	game	_
587	.	_
588	And	_
589	we	(3)
590	were	_
591	off	_
592	.	_
593	The	_
594	hardest	_
595	part	_
596	was	_
597	probably	_
598	to	_
599	overcome	_
600	the	_
601	gagging	_
602	reflex	_
603	that	_
604	set	_
605	in	_
606	when	_
607	you	(14)
608	bit	_
609	down	_
610	into	_
611	the	(23
612	acrid	_
613	resin	_
614	jelly	23)
615	and	_
616	it	(23)
617	flowed	_
618	out	_
619	and	_
620	up	_
621	and	_
622	around	_
623	,	_
624	over	_
625	teeth	_
626	,	_
627	gums	_
628	and	_
629	tongue	_
630	.	_
631	Your	(14)
632	nose	_
633	filled	_
634	with	_
635	what	_
636	you	(14)
637	imagined	_
638	were	_
639	fumes	_
640	from	_
641	the	(23
642	warm	_
643	paste	23)
644	.	_
645	And	_
646	you	(14)
647	seemed	_
648	to	_
649	be	_
650	suddenly	_
651	drowning	_
652	in	_
653	your	(14)
654	own	_
655	saliva	_
656	.	_
657	Things	_
658	generally	_
659	got	_
660	better	_
661	when	_
662	Steven	(1)
663	reminded	_
664	you	(14)
665	that	_
666	you	(14)
667	could	_
668	actually	_
669	breathe	_
670	,	_
671	and	_
672	swallow	_
673	,	_
674	normally	_
675	.	_
676	He	(1)
677	watched	_
678	the	_
679	second	_
680	hand	_
681	trotting	_
682	round	_
683	the	_
684	dial	_
685	of	_
686	his	(1)
687	watch	_
688	mouthing	_
689	the	_
690	quarters	_
691	,	_
692	before	_
693	poking	_
694	the	(23
695	setting	_
696	goo	23)
697	to	_
698	check	_
699	its	(23)
700	consistency	_
701	.	_
702	Then	_
703	,	_
704	when	_
705	he	(1)
706	gave	_
707	you	(14)
708	the	_
709	nod	_
710	,	_
711	you	(14)
712	tried	_
713	to	_
714	prise	_
715	your	(14)
716	jaws	_
717	apart	_
718	.	_
719	As	_
720	the	_
721	seal	_
722	around	_
723	your	(14)
724	gums	_
725	and	_
726	teeth	_
727	was	_
728	pretty	_
729	solid	_
730	,	_
731	you	(14)
732	thought	_
733	it	(20)
734	would	_
735	never	_
736	come	_
737	off	_
738	,	_
739	as	_
740	the	(24
741	others	24)
742	giggled	_
743	at	_
744	your	(14)
745	expressions	_
746	and	_
747	grimaces	_
748	.	_
749	Steven	(1)
750	jiggled	_
751	the	(25
752	handle	_
753	that	_
754	stuck	_
755	out	_
756	beyond	_
757	your	(14)
758	front	_
759	teeth	_
760	like	_
761	some	_
762	metallic	_
763	duck	_
764	’s	_
765	bill	25)
766	,	_
767	turning	_
768	and	_
769	twisting	_
770	it	(25)
771	most	_
772	professionally	_
773	and	_
774	murmuring	_
775	encouragements	_
776	.	_
777	And	_
778	,	_
779	then	_
780	,	_
781	with	_
782	an	_
783	awful	_
784	sucking	_
785	slurp	_
786	,	_
