86	A	_
87	few	_

101	her	(2)
102	to	_
103	church	_
104	.	_
105	He	(1)
106	remembered	_

111	the	_
112	colorful	_

152	when	_

211	,	_

214	Tyler	(1)
215	was	_

360	At	_

472	One	_

474	Tyler	(12)

501	He	(19)
502	was	_
503	surprised	_
504	to	_
505	discover	(20)
506	that	_
507	the	(17

544	.	_
545	Now	_
546	he	(19)

552	in	_
553	the	_

594	Somehow	_
595	,	_

633	abandonment	_
634	and	_

636	.	_
637	In	_
638	his	(19)

657	This	(10)
