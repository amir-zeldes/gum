143	me	(2)

145	poverty	_
146	and	_
147	failure	_
148	and	_
149	political	_

155	days	_
156	,	_
157	contagious	_
158	and	_
159	synonymous	_
160	.	_
161	The	_
162	young	_
163	were	_
164	mostly	_
165	dead	_
166	,	_
167	and	_
168	the	(8

170	men	8)
171	had	_
172	been	_
173	taken	_
174	away	_
175	,	_
176	they	_
177	told	_
178	us	(9)

197	So	_
198	it	_

200	a	_
201	city	_

291	The	(13

336	the	(13

341	she	(13)
342	walked	_
343	out	_
