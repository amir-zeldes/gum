135	My	(8(1)

223	for	_
224	a	_
225	long	_

228	I	(1)

233	my	(1)
234	back	_
235	a	_
236	little	_
237	,	_
238	I	(1)
239	wanted	_
240	to	_
241	push	_
242	against	_
243	his	(10(8)
244	hand	10)
245	like	_
246	a	_
247	cat	_
248	but	_
249	the	_
250	instinct	_
251	that	_
252	comes	_
253	with	_
254	being	_
255	thirteen	_
256	,	_
257	the	_
258	half	_

268	or	_
269	wild	_
270	,	_
271	the	_
272	shyness	_
273	told	_
274	me	(1)
275	to	_
276	just	_
277	walk	_
278	.	_
279	I	(1)
280	wanted	_
281	to	_
282	feel	_
283	the	_
284	rough	_
285	edge	_
286	of	_
287	the	(13

291	coat	14)13)
292	against	_
293	my	(1)
294	cheek	_
295	,	_
296	but	_
297	I	(1)
298	was	_
299	too	_
300	tall	_
301	.	_
302	I	(1)
303	wanted	_
304	to	_
305	be	_
306	seven	_
307	again	_
308	,	_
309	and	_
310	safe	_
311	.	_
312	But	_
313	I	(1)
314	still	_
315	wanted	_
316	to	_
317	push	_
318	against	_
319	his	(10(8)
320	hand	10)
321	and	_
322	put	_
323	my	(15(1)

333	glove	_
334	,	_
335	that	_
336	secret	_
337	animal	16)
338	.	_
339	Instead	_
340	I	(1)
341	went	_
342	into	_
343	the	(17
344	church	17)
345	,	_
346	took	_
347	a	_
348	Bulletin	_

353	in	_
354	Holy	_
355	Water	_

359	The	_
360	inside	_
361	of	_
362	the	(17
363	church	17)
364	smelled	_

369	furniture	_
370	polish	_
371	,	_
372	not	_
373	alive	_
374	at	_
375	all	_
376	.	_
377	My	(8(1)
378	father	8)
379	took	_
380	off	_
381	his	(14(8)
382	coat	14)
383	and	_
384	draped	_
385	it	(14)
386	over	_
387	the	_
388	edge	_
389	of	_
390	the	_
391	pew	_
392	and	_

394	I	(1)
395	came	_
396	back	_
397	from	_
398	communion	_
399	I	(1)
400	stole	_
401	his	(16(8)

403	.	_
404	The	_
405	paper	_
406	taste	_
407	of	_
408	the	_

415	and	_
416	I	(1)
417	took	_
418	a	_
419	deep	_
420	breath	_
421	of	_
422	the	(18
423	leather	18)
424	.	_
425	It	(18)
426	smelled	_
427	like	_
428	March	(3)
429	.	_
430	We	(19)
431	walked	_
432	back	_
433	through	_
434	the	_
435	school	_
436	because	_
437	it	_
438	was	(20)

457	There	_

478	ended	_
479	in	_
480	a	_
481	T	_
482	and	_
483	we	(19)
484	went	_
485	left	_
486	through	_
487	the	_
488	gym	_

523	thirty	_
524	-	_
525	five	_
526	,	_
527	younger	_
528	because	_
529	he	(8)
530	liked	_
531	to	_
532	be	_
533	outside	_
534	,	_
535	to	_
536	play	_

572	I	(1)

588	I	(1)
589	was	_
590	so	_

593	The	(23

603	There	_

653	On	_
