28	you	(4)

135	My	(8(1)

191	strong	_
192	.	_
193	When	_

220	on	_
221	my	(12(1)
222	head	12)
223	for	_
224	a	_
225	long	_
226	time	_

228	I	(1)

232	arching	_
233	my	(1)
234	back	_
235	a	_
236	little	_
237	,	_
238	I	(1)
239	wanted	_
240	to	_
241	push	_
242	against	_
243	his	(10(8)
244	hand	10)
245	like	_
246	a	_
247	cat	_
248	but	_
249	the	_
250	instinct	_
251	that	_
252	comes	_
253	with	_
254	being	_
255	thirteen	_
256	,	_
257	the	_
258	half-understood	_
259	caution	_
260	that	_
261	makes	_
262	a	_
263	girl	_
264	timid	_
265	,	_
266	or	_
267	wild	_
268	,	_
269	the	_
270	shyness	_
271	told	_
272	me	(1)
273	to	_
274	just	_
275	walk	_
276	.	_
277	I	(1)
278	wanted	_
279	to	_
280	feel	_
281	the	_
282	rough	_
283	edge	_
284	of	_
285	the	(13
286	pocket	_
287	of	_
288	his	(14(8)
289	coat	14)13)
290	against	_
291	my	(1)
292	cheek	_
293	,	_
294	but	_
295	I	(1)
296	was	_
297	too	_
298	tall	_
299	.	_
300	I	(1)
301	wanted	_
302	to	_
303	be	_
304	seven	_
305	again	_
306	,	_
307	and	_
308	safe	_
309	.	_
310	But	_
311	I	(1)
312	still	_
313	wanted	_
314	to	_
315	push	_
316	against	_
317	his	(10(8)
318	hand	10)
319	and	_
320	put	_
321	my	(15(1)
322	hand	15)
323	in	_
324	his	(13(8)

330	palmed	_
331	glove	_
332	,	_
333	that	_
334	secret	_
335	animal	16)
336	.	_
337	Instead	_
338	I	(1)
339	went	_
340	into	_
341	the	(17
342	church	17)
343	,	_
344	took	_
345	a	_
346	Bulletin	_
347	,	_
348	dipped	_
349	my	(1)
350	finger	_
351	in	_
352	Holy	_
353	Water	_
354	and	_
355	genuflected	_
356	.	_
357	The	_
358	inside	_
359	of	_
360	the	(17
361	church	17)
362	smelled	_
363	like	_

365	wood	_
366	and	_
367	furniture	_
368	polish	_
369	,	_
370	not	_
371	alive	_
372	at	_
373	all	_
374	.	_
375	My	(8(1)
376	father	8)
377	took	_
378	off	_
379	his	(14(8)
380	coat	14)
381	and	_
382	draped	_
383	it	(14)
384	over	_
385	the	_
386	edge	_
387	of	_
388	the	_
389	pew	_
390	and	_
391	when	_
392	I	(1)
393	came	_
394	back	_
395	from	_
396	communion	_
397	I	(1)
398	stole	_
399	his	(16(8)
400	glove	16)
401	.	_
402	The	_
403	paper	_
404	taste	_
405	of	_
406	the	_

408	was	_
409	still	_
410	in	_
411	my	(1)

413	and	_
414	I	(1)
415	took	_
416	a	_
417	deep	_
418	breath	_
419	of	_
420	the	(18
421	leather	18)
422	.	_
423	It	(18)
424	smelled	_
425	like	_
426	March	(3)
427	.	_
428	We	(19)
429	walked	_
430	back	_
431	through	_
432	the	_
433	school	_
434	because	_
435	it	_
436	was	(20)
437	drizzling	_
438	,	_
439	my	(8(1)
440	father	8)

455	There	_

476	ended	_
477	in	_
478	a	_
479	T	_
480	and	_
481	we	(19)
482	went	_
483	left	_
484	through	_
485	the	_

513	.	_
514	My	(8(1)

516	was	_
517	a	_
518	young	_
519	man	_
520	,	_
521	thirty-five	_
522	,	_
523	younger	_
524	because	_
525	he	(8)
526	liked	_
527	to	_
528	be	_
529	outside	_
530	,	_
531	to	_
532	play	_
533	softball	_

564	in	_
565	his	(13(8)
566	pockets	13)
567	.	_
568	I	(1)

584	I	(1)

599	There	_
