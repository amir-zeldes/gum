104	it	(3)
105	usually	_

107	when	_
108	my	(1(2)

123	stocked	_
124	with	_

127	.	_
128	We	(6)
129	stood	_
130	by	_

133	,	_
134	washed	_

166	broad	_
167	in	_
168	the	_

170	,	_
171	moaned	_
172	gently	_
173	to	_
174	himself	(10)
175	,	_
176	while	_
177	I	(8)
178	stood	_
179	nervously	_
180	rubbing	_
181	the	_
182	heel	_
183	of	_
184	one	_
185	sandal	_
186	on	_
187	the	_
188	flagstones	_
189	.	_
190	We	(6)
191	scanned	_
192	the	_
193	deep	_
194	blue	_
195	valley	_
196	for	_
197	the	_
198	first	_

201	the	(11
202	company	11)
203	,	_
204	but	_
205	before	_
206	we	(6)
207	saw	_
208	them	(11)
209	we	(6)
210	heard	_
211	the	(12
212	children	12)
213	shouting	_
214	:	_
215	“	_
216	A	(13
217	yellow	_
218	man	13)
219	!	_
220	”	_
221	A	_
222	yellow	_
223	man	_
224	!	_
225	We	(6)
226	glanced	_
227	at	_
228	one	(14
229	another	14)
230	in	_
231	confusion	_
232	.	_
233	My	(7(15)
234	mother	7)
235	bit	_
236	her	(7)
237	lower	_
238	lip	_
239	;	_
240	Jom	(10)
241	gave	_
242	a	_
243	groan	_
244	of	_
245	alarm	_
246	.	_
247	At	_
248	first	_
249	I	(15)
250	thought	_
251	the	(12
252	children	12)
253	meant	_
254	my	(5(15)
255	father	_
256	,	_
257	whose	_

266	-	_
267	monkey	_
268	’s	_
269	pelt	_
270	,	_
271	was	_
272	a	_
273	rarity	_
274	in	_
275	the	_
276	islands	5)
277	;	_
278	but	_
279	certainly	_
280	the	_
281	children	_
282	of	_
283	Tyom	(16)
284	were	_
285	familiar	_
286	with	_
287	my	(5(15)
288	father	5)
289	,	_
290	and	_
291	would	_
292	never	_
293	have	_
294	greeted	_
295	a	_
296	council	_
297	-	_
298	member	_
299	with	_
300	such	_
301	ill	_
302	-	_
303	mannered	_
304	yells	_
305	.	_
306	Then	_
307	I	(15)
308	remembered	_
309	the	(17
310	only	_
311	“	_
312	yellow	_
313	man	_
314	”	_
315	I	(15)
316	had	_
317	ever	_
318	seen	_
319	,	_
320	an	_
321	Olondrian	_
322	wizard	_
323	and	_
324	doctor	_
325	who	_
326	had	_
327	visited	_
328	Tyom	(16)
329	in	_
330	my	(15)
331	childhood	_
332	,	_
333	who	_
334	wore	_
335	two	_
336	pieces	_
337	of	_
338	glass	_
339	on	_
340	his	(9
341	eyes	9)
342	,	_
343	attached	_
344	to	_
345	his	(17)
346	ears	_
347	with	_
348	wires	_
349	,	_
350	and	_
351	roamed	_
352	the	_
353	hills	_
354	of	_
355	Tinimavet	_
356	,	_
357	cutting	_
358	bits	_
359	off	_
360	the	_
361	trees	17)
362	.	_
363	I	(15)
364	have	_
365	since	_
366	learned	_
367	that	_
368	that	(17
369	doctor	17)
370	wrote	_
371	a	_
372	well	_
373	-	_
374	received	_
375	treatise	_
376	,	_
377	On	_

390	died	_
391	a	(18

394	in	_
395	his	(18)
396	native	_
397	city	_
398	of	_
399	Deinivel	_
400	;	_
401	but	_
402	at	_
403	the	_
404	time	_
405	I	(15)
406	felt	_
407	certain	_
408	he	(18)
409	had	_
410	returned	_
411	with	_
412	his	(18)
413	sack	_
414	of	_

434	in	_
435	a	_

438	.	_
439	And	_
440	there	_
441	they	(11)
442	were	_
443	:	_
444	a	(19
445	chain	_
446	of	_

453	My	(5(15)

481	The	_
482	hectic	_
483	screams	_
484	of	_
485	the	_
486	children	_
487	preceded	_
488	the	(19
489	company	19)
490	into	_
491	the	(16
492	village	16)
493	,	_
494	so	_
495	that	_
496	they	(19)
497	advanced	_
498	like	_

509	As	_
510	they	(19)
511	approached	_
512	I	(15)
513	saw	_
514	that	_
515	my	(5(15)
516	father	_
517	’s	5)
518	face	_
519	was	_
520	shining	_

545	rode	_
546	beside	_
547	him	(5)
548	,	_
549	looking	_
550	uncomfortable	_
551	with	_
552	his	_

555	,	_
556	kept	_
557	his	(20)
558	gaze	_

633	As	_

636	in	_
637	front	_
638	of	_
639	the	_

641	I	(15)
642	heard	_

684	I	(15)
