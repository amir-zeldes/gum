100	The	(3

102	began	_
103	as	_
104	it	(3)
105	usually	_
106	did	_
107	when	_
108	my	(1(2)
109	father	1)
110	was	_
111	expected	_
112	home	(4)
113	from	_
114	his	(1)
115	travels	_

117	the	(4

119	festooned	_
120	with	_

122	and	_
123	stocked	_
124	with	_
125	coconut	_
126	liquor	_
127	.	_
128	We	(5)
129	stood	_
130	by	_
131	the	_
132	gate	_
133	,	_
134	washed	_
135	and	_
136	perfumed	_

144	my	(6(2)

161	Jom	(8

166	broad	_
167	in	_
168	the	_
169	shoulders	8)
170	,	_
171	moaned	_
172	gently	_
173	to	_
174	himself	(8)
175	,	_
176	while	_
177	I	(2)
178	stood	_
179	nervously	_
180	rubbing	_
181	the	_
182	heel	_
183	of	_
184	one	_
185	sandal	_
186	on	_
187	the	_
188	flagstones	_
189	.	_
190	We	(5)
191	scanned	_
192	the	_
193	deep	_
194	blue	_
195	valley	_
196	for	_
197	the	_
198	first	_
199	sign	_
200	of	_
201	the	(9
202	company	9)
203	,	_
204	but	_
205	before	_
206	we	(5)
207	saw	_
208	them	(9)
209	we	(5)
210	heard	_
211	the	(10
212	children	10)
213	shouting	_
214	:	_
215	“	_
216	A	(11
217	yellow	_
218	man	11)
219	!	_
220	”	_
221	A	_
222	yellow	_
223	man	_
224	!	_
225	We	(5)
226	glanced	_
227	at	_
228	one	(12
229	another	12)
230	in	_
231	confusion	_
232	.	_
233	My	(6(2)
234	mother	6)
235	bit	_
236	her	(6)
237	lower	_
238	lip	_
239	;	_
240	Jom	(8)
241	gave	_
242	a	_
243	groan	_
244	of	_
245	alarm	_
246	.	_
247	At	_
248	first	_
249	I	(2)
250	thought	_
251	the	(10
252	children	10)
253	meant	_
254	my	(1(2)
255	father	_
256	,	_
257	whose	_
258	golden	_
259	skin	_
260	,	_
261	the	_
262	color	_
263	of	_
264	the	_
265	night-monkey	_
266	’s	_
267	pelt	_
268	,	_
269	was	_
270	a	_
271	rarity	_
272	in	_
273	the	_
274	islands	1)
275	;	_
276	but	_
277	certainly	_
278	the	_
279	children	_
280	of	_
281	Tyom	(13)
282	were	_
283	familiar	_
284	with	_
285	my	(1(2)
286	father	1)
287	,	_
288	and	_
289	would	_
290	never	_
291	have	_
292	greeted	_
293	a	_
294	council-member	_
295	with	_
296	such	_
297	ill-mannered	_
298	yells	_
299	.	_
300	Then	_
301	I	(2)
302	remembered	_
303	the	(14
304	only	_
305	“	_
306	yellow	_
307	man	_
308	”	_
309	I	(2)
310	had	_
311	ever	_
312	seen	_
313	,	_
314	an	_
315	Olondrian	_
316	wizard	_
317	and	_
318	doctor	_
319	who	_
320	had	_
321	visited	_
322	Tyom	(13)
323	in	_
324	my	(2)
325	childhood	_
326	,	_
327	who	_
328	wore	_
329	two	_
330	pieces	_
331	of	_
332	glass	_
333	on	_
334	his	(7
335	eyes	7)
336	,	_
337	attached	_
338	to	_
339	his	(14)
340	ears	_
341	with	_
342	wires	_
343	,	_
344	and	_
345	roamed	_
346	the	_
347	hills	_
348	of	_
349	Tinimavet	_
350	,	_
351	cutting	_
352	bits	_
353	off	_
354	the	_
355	trees	14)
356	.	_
357	I	(2)
358	have	_
359	since	_
360	learned	_
361	that	_
362	that	(14
363	doctor	14)
364	wrote	_
365	a	_
366	well-received	_
367	treatise	_
368	,	_
369	On	_
370	the	_
371	Medicinal	_
372	Properties	_

377	the	_
378	Young	_
379	Coconut	_
380	,	_
381	and	_
382	died	_
383	a	(15
384	respected	_
385	man	15)
386	in	_
387	his	(15)
388	native	_
389	city	_
390	of	_
391	Deinivel	_
392	;	_
393	but	_
394	at	_
395	the	_
396	time	_
397	I	(2)
398	felt	_
399	certain	_
400	he	(15)
401	had	_
402	returned	_
403	with	_
404	his	(15)
405	sack	_
406	of	_
407	tree-cuttings	_
408	.	_
409	“	_
410	There	_

418	the	_

422	in	_
423	a	_
424	strained	_
425	voice	_
426	.	_
427	And	_
428	there	_
429	they	(9)
430	were	_
431	:	_
432	a	(16
433	chain	_
434	of	_
435	riders	_
436	weaving	_
437	among	_
438	the	_

441	My	(1(2)
442	father	_

444	plaited	_

446	appeared	_
447	,	_
448	his	(1)
449	still	_

454	and	_
455	beside	_
456	him	(1)
457	another	(17

469	The	_
470	hectic	_
471	screams	_
472	of	_
473	the	(10
474	children	10)
475	preceded	_
476	the	(16
477	company	16)
478	into	_
479	the	(13
480	village	13)
481	,	_
482	so	_
483	that	_
484	they	(16)
485	advanced	_
486	like	_
487	a	_
488	festival	_
489	,	_
490	drawing	_
491	people	(19)
492	out	_

496	.	_
497	As	_

499	approached	_
500	I	(2)
501	saw	_
502	that	_
503	my	(1(2)
504	father	_
505	’s	1)
506	face	_
507	was	_
508	shining	_

511	,	_
512	and	_
513	his	(20(1)
514	bearing	20)
515	had	_
516	in	_
517	it	(20)
518	a	_
519	new	_
520	hauteur	_
521	,	_

528	kings	_
529	.	_
530	The	(17

532	who	_
533	rode	_
534	beside	_
535	him	(1)
536	,	_
537	looking	_
538	uncomfortable	_
539	with	_
540	his	_
541	long	_
542	legs	17)
543	,	_
544	kept	_
545	his	(17)
546	gaze	_
547	lowered	_

549	fixed	_
550	between	_

553	of	_
554	his	(18(17)
555	plodding	_

558	He	(17)
559	was	_
560	not	_

585	so	_
586	that	_
587	it	_
588	resembled	_
589	a	_

591	.	_
592	He	(17)

629	whispering	_
630	:	_
631	“	_

651	My	(1(2)

659	toward	_
660	us	(12)

662	grinning	_
663	.	_
664	I	(2)
