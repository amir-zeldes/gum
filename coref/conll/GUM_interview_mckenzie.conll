61	Wikinews	(5)

77	[	_
78	The	(13
79	Spitfire	_
80	Tournament	_
81	in	_
82	Canada	(14)13)
83	]	_
84	was	_
85	a	_
86	really	_
87	good	_
88	tournament	_
89	actually	_
90	.	_
91	It	(13)
92	was	_
93	a	_
94	tournament	_
95	that	_
96	I	(6)
97	wish	_
98	we	(7)
99	'd	_
100	actually	_
101	gone	_
102	back	_
103	to	_
104	more	_
105	often	_
106	.	_
107	Who	_
108	plays	_
109	in	_
110	that	(13
111	one	13)
112	?	_
113	It	(13)
114	's	_
115	quite	_
116	a	_
117	large	_
118	Canadian	_
119	tournament	_
120	,	_
121	and	_
122	so	_
123	we	(7)
124	went	_
125	as	_
126	the	(7
127	Gliders	_
128	team	7)
129	.	_
130	So	_
131	we	(7)
132	were	_
133	trying	_
134	to	_
135	get	_
136	as	_
137	many	_
138	international	(15
139	games	15)
140	as	_
141	possible	_
142	.	_
143	Cause	_
144	that	_
145	's	_
146	one	(16
147	of	_
148	our	(7)
149	problems	16)
150	really	_
151	,	_
152	to	(16
153	compete	16)
154	.	_
155	It	(17)
156	costs	_
157	us	(7)
158	so	_
159	much	_
160	money	_
161	to	_
162	for	(17
163	us	_
164	to	_
165	travel	_
166	overseas	_
167	and	_
168	to	_
169	compete	_
170	internationally	17)
171	.	_
172	And	_
173	so	_
174	we	(7)
175	can	_
176	compete	_
177	against	_
178	each	(7
179	other	7)
180	all	_
181	the	_
182	time	_
183	within	_
184	Australia	(3)
185	but	_
186	we	(7)
187	really	_
188	need	_
189	to	_
190	be	_
191	able	_
192	to	_
193	...	_
194	It	_
195	's	_
196	not	_
197	the	_
198	same	_
199	.	_
200	No	_
201	,	_
202	it	_
203	's	_
204	really	_
205	not	_
206	,	_
207	so	_
208	it	_
209	's	_
210	really	_
211	important	_
212	to	_
213	be	_
214	able	_
215	to	_
216	get	_
217	as	_
218	a	_
219	many	(18
220	international	_
221	trips	18)
222	throughout	_
223	the	_
224	year	_
225	to	_
226	continue	_
227	our	(19(7)
228	improvement	19)
229	.	_
230	Also	_
231	see	_
232	where	_
233	all	_
234	the	_
235	other	(20
236	teams	20)
237	are	_
238	at	_
239	as	_
240	well	_
241	.	_
242	But	_
243	yes	_
244	,	_
245	Spitfire	(13)
246	was	_
247	good	_
248	.	_
249	We	(7)
250	took	_
251	quite	_
252	a	(21
253	few	_
254	new	_
255	girls	21)
256	over	_
257	there	(13)

294	?	_
295	No	_
296	,	_
297	I	(6)
298	captained	_
299	in	_

305	2010	(26)
306	World	(25
307	Cup	25)
308	.	_
309	And	_
310	then	_
311	I	(6)

313	a	_
314	bit	_
315	of	_
316	some	_
317	time	_
318	off	_
319	in	_
320	2011	(28)
321	.	_
322	The	(7

325	never	_
326	won	_
327	the	(25

330	.	_
331	We	(29(7)
332	always	_
333	seem	_
334	to	_
335	have	_
336	just	_
337	a	_
338	little	_
339	bit	_
340	of	_
341	a	_
342	chill	_
343	out	_
344	at	_
345	the	(30

348	.	29)
349	I	(6)
350	do	_
351	n't	_
352	know	_
353	why	_
354	.	_
355	It	(29)
356	's	_
357	really	_
358	strange	_
359	occurrence	_
360	,	_
361	over	_
362	the	_
363	years	_
364	.	_
365	2002	(31)
366	World	(30

368	,	_
369	we	(7)
370	won	_
371	bronze	(32)
372	.	_
373	Then	_
374	in	_
375	2006	(33)
376	we	(7)
377	ended	_
378	up	_
379	fourth	_
380	.	_
381	It	(30)
382	was	_
383	one	_
384	of	_
385	the	_
386	worst	_
387	World	(30
388	Cups	30)
389	we	_
390	've	_
391	played	_
392	actually	_
393	.	_
394	And	_
395	then	_
396	in	_
397	2010	(26)
398	we	(7)
399	just	_
400	...	_
401	I	(34)
402	do	_
403	n't	_
404	know	_
405	what	_
406	happened	_
407	.	_
408	We	(7)
409	just	_
410	did	_
411	n't	_
412	play	_
413	as	_
414	well	_
415	as	_
416	we	(7)
417	thought	_
418	we	_
419	would	_
420	.	_
421	Came	_
422	fourth	_
423	.	_
424	But	_
425	you	_
426	know	_
427	what	_
428	?	_
429	Fired	_
430	us	(7)
431	up	_
432	for	_
433	the	(9
434	actual	_
435	Paralympics	9)
436	.	_
437	So	_
438	the	(30
439	World	_
440	Cup	30)
441	is	_
442	...	_
443	it	(35)
444	's	_
445	good	_

453	the	(30
454	World	_
455	Cup	30)
456	,	_
457	to	_
458	be	_
459	placed	35)
460	,	_
461	but	_
462	it	(35)
463	also	_
464	means	_
465	that	_
466	you	_
467	get	_
468	a	_
469	really	_
470	good	_
471	opportunity	_
472	to	_

482	gap	_
483	between	_
484	the	(9
485	Paralympics	36)9)
486	.	_
487	So	_

522	talking	_
523	about	_
524	moving	(38
525	it	(30)38)
526	so	_
527	it	(30)
