The corpus is created as part of the course LING-4427 (Computational Corpus Linguistics) at Georgetown University. For more details see: https://gucorpling.org/gum.

## A note about Reddit data

For one of the 24 text types in this corpus, Reddit forum discussions, plain text data is not supplied, and you will find ❗**underscores**❗ in place of word forms in documents from this data (files named `GUM_reddit_*`). To obtain this data, please run `python get_text.py`, which will allow you to reconstruct the text in these files. This, and all data, is provided with absolutely no warranty; users agree to use the data under the license with which it is provided, and Reddit data is subject to Reddit's terms and conditions. See [README_reddit.md](README_reddit.md) for more details.

Note that the `get_text.py` script only regenerates the files named `GUM_reddit_*` in each folder, and will not create full versions of the data in `PAULA/` and `annis/`. If you require PAULA XML or searchable ANNIS data containing these documents, you will need to recompile the corpus from the source files under `_build/src/`. To do this, run `_build/process_reddit.py`, then run `_build/build_gum.py`. 

You can also run searches in the complete version of the corpus using [our ANNIS server](https://gucorpling.org/annis/#_c=R1VN)

## Train / dev / test / test2 splits

Two documents from each completed genre are reserved for testing and devlopment, but currently growing genres only have one each (total: 32 test documents, 32 dev documents). An additional out-of-domain test2 partition is available with 26 documents from the [GENTLE](https://gucorpling.org/gum/gentle.html) corpus, representing 8 additional 'extreme' genres, such as poetry, eSports commentary and more, which are not represented in the training data. See [splits.md](splits.md) for the official training, development and testing partitions.

## Citing

The best paper to cite depends on the data you are using. To cite the corpus in general, please refer to the following article (but note that the corpus has changed and grown a lot in the time since); otherwise see different citations for specific aspects below:

## Directories

The corpus is downloadable in multiple formats. Not all formats contain all annotations: The most accessible format is probably CoNLL-U dependencies (in `dep/`), but the most complete XML representation is in [PAULA XML](https://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/en/paula.html), and the easiest way to search in the corpus is using [ANNIS](http://corpus-tools.org/annis). Here is [an example query](https://gucorpling.org/annis/#_q=ZW50aXR5IC0-YnJpZGdlIGVudGl0eSAmICMxIC0-aGVhZCBsZW1tYT0ib25lIg&_c=R1VN&cl=5&cr=5&s=0&l=10) for phrases headed by 'one' bridging back to a different, previously mentioned entity. Other formats may be useful for other purposes. See website for more details.
