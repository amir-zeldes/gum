So the Secretary identified various provisions in Title IV that govern the terms and conditions of student loans and also govern discharge and cancellation in other circumstances , as your question suggested . And I think the straightforward way to think about how the verbs map onto the Secretary 's action is that he waived elements of those provisions that contain eligibility requirements for discharge and cancellation that are inapplicable under this program and then modified the provisions to contain the limitations that he had announced as part and parcel of announcing this loan forgiveness . Now you had suggested that there 's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal , and that 's true , but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision , and so the HEROES Act is n't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute . I do n't think anything can be read into the fact that there 's no express reference to particular forms of relief because Congress was trying to broadly cover the field and ensure that the Secretary had the tools to respond to the national emergency with whatever relief might be necessitated . But , in an opinion we had a few years ago by Justice Scalia , he talked about what the word " modify " means , and he said modified in our view connotes moderate change . He said it might be good English to say that the French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility , but only because there 's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm . We 're talking about half a trillion dollars and 43 million Americans . How does that fit under the normal understanding of " modifying " ? So , of course , I recognize that in MCI , Justice Scalia 's opinion adopted a narrower understanding of that term , but I do n't read that opinion to set forth a universal meaning of " modify , " no matter the statutory context . And , here , of course , we have a broader phrase , " waive or modify . " It 's undisputed and the states are n't contesting that the ordinary meaning of " waive " means to eliminate an obligation in its entirety . And I think , if you look at that phrase in the context of the statute , that means that " modify " has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination . It would be really strange for Congress to say you can eliminate obligations altogether or tweak them just the littlest bit , but you ca n't do anything in between . Well , but it 's " waive " particular regulatory or statutory provisions . That 's right . That to me suggests a much more focused use of the word .
