Some of the greatest poetry has been born out of failure and the depths of adversity in the human experience . Walt Whitman , the first great American poet , wrote about the Civil War . He went looking for his brother , George Whitman , after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South . When he started out his poems were about beating drums , and blow , bugle , blow . Real patriotic . Then he started to see the real horrors of war . He was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time . Eventually when he found his brother he had resolution . I experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer . I loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero . I turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now . When I wrote my 9/11 - related poems , that was true adversity .
