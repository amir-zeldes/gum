GUM_voyage_phoenix	147-161	162-347	Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert ?	The answer is , surprisingly , agriculture . The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large - scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century . The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture , which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages , whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day . White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century . The city 's name reflects its history as a city " reborn from the ashes " of the previous settlement . European - American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s , and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation - based agriculture . Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops , and for many years , intensive , year - round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy .	147-161	162-347	Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert ?
