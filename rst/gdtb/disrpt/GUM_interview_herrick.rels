Sure . wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world 's largest , highest quality how - to manual . Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language . We 're quite far from our goals currently , but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles . We hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status . That said , we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve . However , in terms of readership , we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia . We get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast .

This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets .

We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) . In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . " If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere . This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license . This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community . I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far . My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others . That said , when we started out I did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license . As a result , we made some mistakes along the path . In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY - SA license instead of CC - BY - SA - NC . At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects .	876-886	887-1135	Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license ?
