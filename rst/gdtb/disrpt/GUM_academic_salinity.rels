The wind - roughened sea surface is associated with the increased brightness temperature ( due to sea surface roughness effect ) , which induces regional biases when applied to different areas [ 32 ] .	824-863	864-898	In addition , the widely used empirical models decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects , which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind - roughened sea surface .
