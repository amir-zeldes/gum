GUM_interview_cyclone	20-45	46-415	Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ?	Yes , all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters . Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land , the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate . As of the last advisory , T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track . That is a Category 3 storm . The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours . However , there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path . Yes , it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land . This occurs for two reasons : As it moves over land , it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [ which is ] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface ; Increased friction - the ocean surface is much , much smoother than the land surface . Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat , which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain . As tropical cyclones make landfall , this energy source is cut - off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land . Yes , the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land . Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land . In the mean time , much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength . Yes . All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall . However , they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding . Phailin 's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland . Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength . However , and this is important , it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty .	20-45	46-415	Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ?

I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm . However , historically , there have been several events that should cause a societal response .

The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US $ 10 billion .

The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past . The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate . Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out , which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations .

I can not comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone . However , the news reports ( BBC etc. ) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding .
