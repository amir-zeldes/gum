GUM_textbook_artwork	1-23	24-330	A relevant question to our concern might be , would this artistic excellence in the Chinese tradition be the same as beauty ?	Arguably , beauty is regarded as the keyword in Western art tradition since antiquity . If we browse Chinese classical writings on art criticism , a striking difference manifests — there the category of mei or beauty does not have a dominant presence . For instance , among the 24 aesthetic categories of poetry listed by Sikong Tu 司空 图 ( 837 – 908 ) in his celebrated treatise ( Sikong n.d. ) , only three or four categories can be regarded as related to the Western notion of beauty . Moreover , according to Xu Hong ’s ( c. 1580 – 1660 ) Xishan Qinkuang 谿山 琴况 ( c. 1640 ) , the most influential treatise on the aesthetics of guqin ( Chinese zither ) music , the category of li ( pretty , beautiful ) is merely the 10th of the 24 aesthetic categories , and the top six were harmony , tranquillity , clarity , profundity , antiquity , subtlety . [ 38 ] In Chinese paintings , prominence was given to the categories such as shen ( spiritual ) and miao ( subtle ) before mei . Overall , one also finds that the comparison between the beautiful and the sublime — which defined the influential aesthetics of Edmund Burke ( 1729 – 1797 ) and Immanuel Kant , and consequently became an iconic discourse in Western aesthetics — is also missing in the Chinese history of aesthetics . To conclude , in a cross-cultural comparative context , it is fair to say that an inquiry on what makes an artwork beautiful may turn out to be even less productive than in the contemporary artworld . 38. 和 , 静 , 清 , 远 , 古 , 澹 ( Research Institute of Music 2010 , vol. 14 , 316 – 321 ) .	1-23	24-330	A relevant question to our concern might be , would this artistic excellence in the Chinese tradition be the same as beauty ?
