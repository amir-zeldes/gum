GUM_textbook_grit	5-50	51-162	Questions to consider : How do different types of motivation affect my learning ? What is resilience and grit ? How can I apply the Uses and Gratification Theory to make decisions about my learning ? How do I prevent negative bias from hindering learning ?	In this section , you will continue to increase your ability as an informed learner . Here you will explore how much of an influence motivation has on learning , as well as how to use motivation to purposefully take an active role in any learning activity . Rather than passively attempting to absorb new information , you will learn how to make conscious decisions about the methods of learning you will use ( based on what you intend to do with the information ) , how you will select and use learning materials that are appropriate for your needs , and how persistent you will be in the learning activity .	5-50	51-162	Questions to consider : How do different types of motivation affect my learning ?
