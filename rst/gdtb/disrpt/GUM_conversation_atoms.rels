By now I 'm sure you 're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here , but first , I would like to talk to you about these three items . I have here , some ice in a pan , water in this glass , and steam rising from this pot . Now , I would like to ask you , how these three things . Tell me please . How are they all alike . These three things . This ice here in this pan . This water in this glass , and the steam rising from this pot , just yell it out , we are informal here , yes .	Correct .
