I understand you think you 're very tough and you think that by dragging this process out you have created me a lot of misery ; that is an incorrect assessment , but I must admit I have run out of patience with you and your smug attitude . I hope the fact that I 've obviously paid someone to find you conveys the seriousness with which I take your current attitude . If you resolve this issue quickly and efficiently I can guarantee you will not hear from me again ; if you do n't , well , you will be well known to the Citibank customers you are currently in litigation with in a very short amount of time . Again , make my life easy , fax over the letter , and you will not be hearing from me again . PS : I took the liberty of buying the corporate phone directory and locating information on your outstanding disputed credit accounts from an internet dealer today , and can probably make you better known to your customers than the security measures you enact at your company indicate you would like . Consider this , as I 'm sure , being in the collections business and having the attitude about it that you do , that you often make people upset . Lord knows that drawing too much publicity and making people upset is what did in Joan Lefkow .
