Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede Thursday , January 12 , 2006 The Plains of Arafat on the day of Hajj According to the Saudi Interior Ministry over 345 Muslim pilgrims have been killed in a stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage near Mecca , Saudi Arabia . The stampede at Islam 's most holy site happened at Jamarat Bridge , during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of Satan as part of the final rites of the Hajj . The stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall , causing a bottleneck . Those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them . Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca during their lifetimes , if physically or financially possible , as it is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith . Saudi officials had already provided safeguards by installing an oval wall with padded edges to protect pilgrams from a crush , installed security cameras and placed over 60,000 security personnel in the area . This is not the first time deadly stampedes have taken place during the Hajj , with the deadliest stampede during the 1991 Hajj , in which 1,426 pilgrims were trampled . Last week , at least 76 people were killed when the Al - Ghaza Hotel near the Masjid Al - Haram ( Grand Mosque ) collasped , the cause of which is unknown .
