19 70 Jan. 10 dear mum , sure enough we had creative days these past two days . Frankly I think it was one of their biggest mistakes ; to make them be so soon after vacation . I was n't creative at all , but did catch up on my sleep . I forgot to get two more checks from you . Both are for $ 15 , one is Wesleyan and the other is Syracuse . The grapefruit apparently arrived before vacation , but smart Mrs. Bonde put them in the big kitchen refrig. I 've already had 5 out of the 9 . Boy , were they delicious ! wish i could have more ? ! About my expenses . I 've been thinking that $ 20 - $ 25 per month would be fine . Why do n't you just give me $ 130 in a lump or send me a monthly check . I prefer the latter . Last Wed. was responsibility Day . We had discussion groups about the hand book and certain situations . I really wish they 'd waited for the creative days ; in the middle of Feb. I would have been ready for them , and would have done something very creative . I did the picture of the family and I 'm so mad â€˜cuz only 1 came out . I ca n't under stand it . I still do n't know how to work that camera . It all has to do with the speed and shutter settings . One was n't slow enough & the other was n't open op enough . Hopefully I 'll get more on the next roll . I ca n't believe we 've got achievements . today . Oh , eck ! I heard from Adelle that already 25 have been accepted at Wesleyan , that leaves 75 more , I already know of 6 kids ten times more competent than I , who are applying . Rats ! got ta go now . give my love to all , say " hullo " to Wila . Love ya . Marcie P.S. What about Kittie ?
