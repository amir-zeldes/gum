How to Annoy People in Elevators An elevator is almost the perfect environment to be a prankster . It ’s easy to annoy people when you are cramped in such a small , tight space . Because elevator rides usually last less than a minute , make sure your pranks are quick and have a lot of punch . When annoying people on an elevator , keep your pranks lighthearted and fun as opposed to mean - spirited so that everyone leaving the elevator will have a pleasant story to tell . Method 1 Using the Elevator to Annoy People Push all the buttons . When you get into the elevator , push the button for every floor . This makes everyone ’s ride on the elevator longer , if only for a few seconds . If you want to take it a step further , look around questioningly at everyone in the elevator when no one gets off at the floors you pushed . [ 1 ] When someone comes in , say , " I 've got this , " before you push all of the buttons . You can also push all the buttons as you reach the floor you are getting off at . If someone asks you why you pushed all the buttons , you can honestly say , " It was just a joke ! " Make a dinging noise at each floor . Every time the elevator reaches a new floor , say “ ding ! ” very loudly . You can even sing the word “ ding ” on each floor like notes in a scale , getting higher as you reach each new floor . [ 2 ] You can make other noises if you prefer , such as a bird cawing or an explosion sound every time a button is pushed . Talk to your reflection in the mirror . Many elevators have mirrors on the walls . A great way to be mischievous in an elevator is to carry on a running commentary while you look at yourself in the mirror . You could look at yourself , turning to catch different angles and say “ All right , all right , now we ’re talking , ” very loudly . You could also keep adjusting your shirt or your hair , keeping a running dialogue about what look is best for you . Stand in the corner of the elevator facing the wall . Do n't say anything the whole ride . Dance to the elevator music . Many elevators play music in the background , usually soft rock or smooth jazz . If you ’re in an elevator that is playing music , start to dance . Start just bobbing your head and tapping your feet , and then get your whole body into it . Take up as much space as you can to dance until everyone is staring at you . [ 3 ] Announce every floor . At every floor , make a loud announcement telling everyone the floor number . Say something like “ Everyone going to floor ten , get off now ! No time to dilly dally ! ” [ 4 ] You can also pretend to conduct people onto the elevator , saying “ All aboard the elevator train ! ” Exclaim that you 've lost a beast . When the elevator is going from the bottom floor to the top , as soon as the doors close , exclaim that you lost your tarantula / snake / scorpion but confirm that it is somewhere in the elevator . Most people will probably see that this is a joke . However , if somebody looks seriously alarmed or is starting to panic , let them know that you were not being serious . Build in or add something to the elevator . For example , build a Lego city in the middle of the elevator . Lay a Twister mat on the floor and ask people if they want to play . Talk to people . When there are a lot of people , say , " You 're probably wondering why I 've gathered you here today . "
