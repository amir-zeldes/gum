Daniel Bernoulli Daniel Bernoulli FRS ( German pronunciation : [ bɛʁˈnʊli ] ; 8 February 1700 – 17 March 1782 ) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family . He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics , especially fluid mechanics , and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics . His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli 's principle , a particular example of the conservation of energy , which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century : the carburetor and the airplane wing . Daniel Bernoulli Early life Frontpage of Hydrodynamica ( 1738 ) Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen , in the Netherlands , into a family of distinguished mathematicians . The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp , at that time in the Spanish Netherlands , but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Huguenots . After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel , in Switzerland . Daniel was a son of Johann Bernoulli ( one of the " early developers " of calculus ) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli ( who " was the first to discover the theory of probability " ) . He had two brothers , Niklaus and Johann II . Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as " by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis " . He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father . Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris , Johann , unable to bear the " shame " of being compared Daniel 's equal , banned Daniel from his house . Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel 's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica . Despite Daniel 's attempts at reconciliation , his father carried the grudge until his death . Around schooling age , his father , Johann , encouraged him to study business , there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician . However , Daniel refused , because he wanted to study mathematics . He later gave in to his father 's wish and studied business . His father then asked him to study in medicine , and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately , which they continued for some time . Daniel studied medicine at Basel , Heidelberg , and Strasbourg , and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721 . He was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler . He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics , but was very unhappy there , and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg . He returned to the University of Basel , where he successively held the chairs of medicine , metaphysics , and natural philosophy until his death . In May , 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society . Mathematical work His earliest mathematical work was the Exercitationes ( Mathematical Exercises ) , published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach . Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation . His chief work is Hydrodynamica , published in 1738 ; it resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange 's Mécanique Analytique in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle , namely , conservation of energy . This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides , to which , conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and Colin Maclaurin , a prize was awarded by the French Academy : these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of Isaac Newton 's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and the investigations of Pierre - Simon Laplace . Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions , especially on problems connected with vibrating strings , and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert . Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids . In particular , they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure . To investigate this , Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid 's pressure in the pipe . Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients ' blood pressure by sticking point - ended glass tubes directly into their arteries . It was not until about 170 years later , in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today . However , Bernoulli 's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane ; that is its air speed . Taking his discoveries further , Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy . It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height . Daniel realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure . Mathematically this law is now written : ½ ρ u 2 + P = constant where P is pressure , ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity . A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls . This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases . The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing , so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing .
