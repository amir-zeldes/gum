Bake for 18 - 20 minutes . If you can smell the cupcakes earlier , check to make sure they are n't browning earlier ( this means they 're more than ready ) .

If they smell strongly earlier , test with a wooden skewer ; if it returns clean after sticking into a cupcake , they 're ready . Remove from the oven . Transfer the cupcakes to a wire cooling rack as quickly as possible when cool enough to handle . Let cool completely on the rack . Frost as desired . Add standard frosting or make vegan butter cream . Tips You can add pureed fruit for delicious flavor changes . One small container of pureed fruit is sufficient for flavoring ( the little containers that children take to school in their lunchboxes . ) Try strawberry , apple , banana , apricot , peach etc. The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy , however , so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus . Instead of using vegan sugar , you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup Instead of using vegetable oil , try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you . Coconut oil also produces good results . And olive oil works fine if it 's all that 's left in the pantry . You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes . Experiment with the flavors of either recipe by replacing the vanilla extract with fragrant ingredients like neroli orange oil , rosewater , orange blossom water or coconut extract .
