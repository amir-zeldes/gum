Daniel Montalvo , 19 , a member of Scientology all his life , was arrested after leaving its elite group the Sea Org . He was released on US$ 20,000 bail on Thursday . Montalvo was charged with taking hard drives and a zip drive from the Scientology organization after leaving the Sea Org group . The Sea Org requires members to sign a billion - year - contract , agreeing to work for the organization founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard for multiple lifetimes . Members of the Sea Org live a strict lifestyle â€“ with little income , small diet provided and significant time invested in work per day . Montalvo had read an article in the Scientology propaganda publication Freedom Magazine , which attacked high - ranking defectors from the organization including Tom Devocht and Mark Rathbun . Montalvo had known Devocht personally , and came to the conclusion that the claims made about him in the Freedom article were lies . Montalvo was subsequently motivated to seek out information about Scientology on the Internet , and came upon a blog written by Rathbun . Montalvo contacted former members of Scientology , who helped him leave the organization and get in touch with Devocht . He traveled to Florida to meet with Devocht , who had told Montalvo he would assist him with future employment and housing . According to Rathbun the Scientology property in question was returned by mail to the organization by Montalvo shortly after he left the Sea Org . Scientology officials have stated they have not received the materials . After calling the Scientology organization by phone to attempt to speak with his mother , Montalvo was instead put through to a Scientology attorney , Kendrick Moxon . Rathbun wrote , " Moxon proceeded to lie to Daniel that the hard drives were never returned , and made a convincing case ( not difficult to do with a 19 year old who does not even know the three branches of government ) that Daniel would be put behind iron bars for a good long time , UNLESS of course , he returned and cooperated with Moxon and routed out properly . " To " route out " in Scientology jargon refers to the member who wishes to leave proceeding through a set of interrogative exit interviews while attached to the Scientology device called the E-meter . According to Rathbun , a detective for the Los Angeles Sheriff 's office was provided with material from Scientology to build a case against Montalvo . Rathbun stated , " Daniel was picked up by an investigator in a black car with blacked out windows . Instead of being taken to a hotel , where he could route out as promised , he was taken to the Century City Towers . He was deposited in an office on the 33rd floor where a pricy church lawyer interrogated him for two hours . " Rathbun asserted that Scientology officials , " ... plied the Sheriff 's detective with a grand conspiracy theory , characterizing me as the ' anti-christ ' of the church of Scientology . ... The next thing Daniel knows he 's in a cell where he sat for the next 30 hours . " Steve Whitmore , a representative for the LA Sheriff 's office , told LA Weekly in a statement that the case involving Montalvo was being dealt with as charges relating to grand theft . Whitmore stated Montalvo left Scientology - related employment in Los Angeles on September 24 . On September 29 , Scientology officials went to the East Los Angeles sheriff 's station where they claimed Montalvo allegedly left the organization with computer hard drives . Whitmore told LA Weekly that on October 6 after traveling back from Florida , Montalvo " walked into lobby of the East L.A. station and turned himself in " , and told the police , " everything he did " . Whitmore stated to LA Weekly that the alleged crime involved five hard drives each of $ 200 in value . Montalvo has been assisted by former members of Scientology , including musician Tiziano Lugli and actor Jason Beghe . Rathbun requested donations via a statement made on his blog , in order to help Montalvo with his legal defense financing . He described Montalvo as an individual , " facing the penitentiary in thanks for the following sins : a) Leaving a lifehood of slavery to get a taste of freedom and the world . b) Refusing - despite every provocation and incentive and threat - to frame three guys who went out of their ways ( and dipped into their pockets ) to help the kid achieve that freedom .
