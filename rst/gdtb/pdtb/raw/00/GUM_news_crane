At least 107 killed in Mecca crane collapse Saturday , September 12 , 2015 pilgrims at Mecca 's Grand Mosque in 2008 . A storm yesterday caused a crane to fall into Mecca 's Grand Mosque , killing 107 or more and wounding 238 , according to Saudi Arabia 's Civil Defense Authority . Civil Defense Authority director General Suleiman al - Amr , in remarks to al - Ikhbariya television , said " All those who were wounded and the dead have been taken to hospital . There are no casualties left at the location . " The accident , which occurred yesterday afternoon , was caused by strong winds and heavy rain that led the crane to fall . Photos released of the scene showed numerous bloodied bodies and various scattered debris . The accident occurred at a time when the mosque was relatively uncrowded . " Had it happened an hour later it would have been much worse , " Khaled Al - Maeena , editor at large at the Saudi Gazette , said . " Had it happened five hours earlier or four hours earlier , I think the death toll would have been more than a thousand . " The crane accident comes just ten days before the beginning of the Hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca , Islam 's holiest site . As undergoing a pilgrimage to Mecca is a mandatory religious duty for all Muslims who physically and financially can , millions of pilgrims arrive in Mecca each year for the Hajj . Construction was underway at the mosque in order to enlarge the mosque and improve crowd control , which has been a recurring problem during Mecca 's pilgrimages .
