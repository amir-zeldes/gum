Greek court rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal Monday , March 27 , 2006 Greek court has ruled that worshippers of the ancient Greek religion may now formally associate and worship at archeological sites . Prior to the ruling , the religion was banned from conducting public worship at archeological sites by the Greek Ministry of Culture . Due to that , the religion was relatively secretive . The Greek Orthodox Church , a Christian denomination , is extremely critical of worshippers of the ancient deities . Today , about 100,000 Greeks worship the ancient gods , such as Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , Aphrodite , and Athena . The Greek Orthodox Church estimates that number is closer to 40,000 . Many neo - pagan religions , such as Wicca , use aspects of ancient Greek religions in their practice ; Hellenic polytheism instead focuses exclusively on the ancient religions , as far as the fragmentary nature of the surviving source material allows .
