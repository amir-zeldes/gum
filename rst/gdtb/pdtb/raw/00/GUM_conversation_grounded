What 'd you do Sabrina ? Nothing . I left the phone in my bedroom last night , and so I 'm grounded from the phone . It was an accident . You guys are always in trouble . What 's up with that ? Mom 's a bitch . Get your feet off of there . Get your feet off of there . You 're so stupid thinking I spent the night . I came home last night and told you . Kendra , just let it go . You — No , because she does n't — All you said last night was — She thinks I spent the night in my jeans — Kim was n't staying the night . If I did spend the night , and I was trying to lie , I would give up , cause then I would n't care , cause I knew I deserved it . But I did n't spend the night , and I do n't deserve this . Kim could n't spend the night , I told you . She could , but then af- — I wanted to stay at the game longer . And her mom wanted to take her home early , and I 'm like , no let 's stay longer . But her mom would n't let her . And so she went home and , I was like , I 'll call you when I get home , and then you come over . And she goes , no just spend the night . We 'll do this some other weekend . Okay cool , cause she had to go bowling in the morning . Talk to Melanie 's mom . Her mom would know . I 'll have Melanie call you . Oh . Her mom call you — Right , right . Her mom would n't lie . Right , Melanie will call me to confirm your lie . Melanie lies but — You 'll get a hold of her first . I know how that works . No , Melanie 's mom . I thought Melanie did n't have a phone . But I 'm supposed to call Melanie 's mom . I did n't want you to have her phone number . Yeah , another lie . Remember ? That was a long time ago . Now I 'm supposed to re- — A- and I 'm supposed to trust you every time you tell the truth . But how am I supposed to know when you 're telling the truth ? That was a joke . That was a joke . Yeah , and I 'm supposed to read your mind and know what you 're joking about . No but , it was a joke . You know Kendra , y- — I do n't know how many times I got ta tell you , once you lie , once you lie — Are they having a carwash ? You lose th- complete trust . No . Yeah they are . Yeah that 's what it is a — We should have a carwash there . Carwash and a bakesale . They 're not getting any people though . Mm . Hot out . What 's that supposed to be ? They 're making it into something . You 're not going anywhere for a while . It 's a bookstore . Really ? God , I did n't spend the night , that 's what makes me so mad , I 'm grounded for nothing . I was home all night last night , I came home and told you . And even my cuffs and everything 's on my bed . So stupid . Next time if I leave in the morning , I 'll wake you up . Mom I 'm awake now , I 'm leaving . Well you woke me up last night , to tell me Kim was n't spending the night . I do n't know why you could n't wake me up in the morning , to tell me that you were going . You guys wake me up every time I 'm trying to take a little nap . What if we are awake ? I was tired this morning . So much fun . My hair looks like a mess . I left it in a ponytail , I did n't even have time to take a shower . I think if I spent the night I would 've took a shower . All I need is your signature so I can play the volleyball . On the volleyball team . No . No . Why ? It 's just volleyball . It 's f- like on Saturdays and Wednesdays . It 's for church . It 's fun . You have practice every Wednesday . Yeah but , not at uh — This is at six thirty . I do n't care . And Susan 's going to it too . Mm . Who cut the grass ? Marlena did it . Marlena did it a long time ago , but it has n't been watered . It 's dying . I know . Gon na rip your purse . I know . See if I spent the night mom , you 'd think I 'd still be in my uniform ? I know she 's — J- she — See now she 's trying to think of ways to cover her tracks . I know what you 're doing . Seen this before . I 'm hungry . Shit . I love your jeans . Cause I wanted to go to the bathroom when you 're done . Anyways , they were not . Did you get a Sawzall ? Yes , it 's right here . Oh . I got the blades . They 're right here . Do you remember the uh , program on TV , about Hantavirus ? About what virus ? Hantavirus . Hutter ? What 's that about ? I do n't re- – I do n't remember . It 's the one from the dead mice . Oh , yeah . Is it , is it all over now ? Is it for real now ? Is it in here ? Is it in the United States now ? They said , they already determined it was in like eighteen different states . What ?

I kn- — Oh oh I know . I mean that 's the thing I thought of too . Well , it 's all packed up in garbage bags now . I did n't even touch it . Used a hoe , stuffed it . I did n't touch anything . Do n't touch anything yellow . Okay ? Not with your gloves or anything . Find something else to pick it up with . Mhm . Did you — did you put it in a trash bag ?
