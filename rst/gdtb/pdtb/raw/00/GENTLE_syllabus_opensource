Policies These will be designated by the instructor in advance to the student and will deal with the following issues . Lateness Late submissions receive a penalty of 10 % with an additional 10 % penalty ( 20 % total ) for up to a week late . Assignments are not generally accepted more than one week late . Class participation Regular attendance and participation is expected . Attendance Regular attendance and participation is expected . Missed exams or assignments : A formal excused absence is required to make up a missed assignment or to turn in an assignment after the due date . Integrity Student - teacher relationships are built on trust . For example , students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach , and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own . Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process . In this course , collaboration in your project group ( 3 or 4 students ) is allowed , but should not be abused . Do not copy blindly . Labs and Quizzes should be solved and written by individuals alone . If anyone is caught cheating , severe measures will be taken such as lowering the final grade , and the event will be reported to the appropriate authorities in the campus . The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the Graduate Student Supplement ( For 6000 level and above courses ) define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these . All assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student â€™s own work . In cases where help was received , or teamwork was allowed , a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration . Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will result in (1) an academic ( grade ) penalty and (2) reporting to the Dean of Academic Affairs and either the Dean of Students ( for Undergraduates ) or the Dean of Graduate Education ( for Graduate students ) . In this course , the academic penalty for a first offense is loss of a letter grade . A second offense will result in failure of the course . If you have any questions concerning this policy before submitting an assignment , please ask for clarification .
