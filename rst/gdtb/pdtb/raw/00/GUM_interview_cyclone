Wikinews interviews meteorological experts on Cyclone Phalin File photo of interviewee David Titley . Image : David Titley . Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ? Yes , all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters . Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land , the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate . As of the last advisory , T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track . That is a Category 3 storm . The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours . However , there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path . Yes , it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land . This occurs for two reasons : As it moves over land , it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [ which is ] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface ; Increased friction - the ocean surface is much , much smoother than the land surface . Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat , which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain . As tropical cyclones make landfall , this energy source is cut - off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land . Yes , the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land . Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land . In the mean time , much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength . Yes . All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall . However , they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding . Phailin 's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland . Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength . However , and this is important , it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty .

Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone ? I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm . However , historically , there have been several events that should cause a societal response . Hopefully , we all learn from past mistakes . The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US $ 10 billion . I do n't have enough information to answer this question , one way or the other . From all the press reports that I have read , the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed . The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past . The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate . Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out , which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations . Unfortunately , extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation . My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space . I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history . This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin . I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [ ... ] sponsored by the Indian government . Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region , the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives . I can not comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone . However , the news reports ( BBC etc. ) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding . Water is the main killer in these storms . From all reports that I have seen , the government was well prepared for this cyclone . For this question I do n't know the ' preparedness ' of the Indian gov't to deal with this .
