The Chatham Islands The Chatnam Islands ( Rekohu in the indigenous Moriori language ) are the eastern - most settled islands in New Zealand . The islands are in their own time zone , 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time ; the International Date Line jogs eastward to keep them on the same calendar day as the rest of New Zealand . The islands lie 860 km east of Christchurch , in the middle of the " Roaring Forties " . Steeped in culture and history , these islands are on the very edge of civilisation . Experience Moriori culture , experience Rekohu . Understand The Chatham Islands consist of the main island , Chatham Island itself , with a population of 600 , smaller Pitt Island with about 40 inhabitants , and a number of rocky outcrops . The islands are volcanic in origin and have a unique and sensitive habitat that supports many rare and endangered species . The original people of the islands are the Moriori , who were descended from the Maori of mainland New Zealand , but who developed their own culture and variant of the language . In 1835 Maori settlers from the mainland arrived , massacred and enslaved the Moriori . Get in By plane The only way for visitors to travel to the Chathams is via scheduled or chartered air service . Air Chathams fly 5 days per week , from either Christchurch , Auckland or Wellington and , seasonally , from Napier . The plane is based in the Chathams and flies to mainland New Zealand in the morning , then back to the Chathams in the afternoon . As part of New Zealand , there are no passport or visa requirements and no border controls on arrival from the mainland . You should book or ensure accommodation before you board a flight for the Chathams , as during the popular months of the tourism season , between October and April , accommodation can be severely limited . There are no same - day return flights , so once there you have to stay at least one night . Although flying to the Chathams and back is not cheap , it is worth it . Even the mainland school groups that fly there for school camps , and choose to stay at Kopinga Marae [ 1 ] get value for money by chartering a flight one way . Anyway , you do n't have a choice on how you get there , unless you happen to own an aeroplane . However , when you get off that aeroplane , if you have n't pre-organised transport , you will have to walk , and it is a long way into town . By boat The only scheduled shipping service to the Chatham Islands remains the Black Robin Freighters " Rangatira " , an antiquated , slow and small coastal trading vessel . This boat has serviced the islands for many years , but does not carry passengers . Freight charges on the Rangatira appear to be flexible and subject to change . Vessels can call at the Chathams and there are a number of " safe " harbours for shelter if the need arises . Remember to notify the local policeman , or Ministry of Fisheries officer if you are entering New Zealand via the Chathams . If you want a wharf berthage then call the local harbour master as you near the Chathams and he will sort you out . Get around There are several businesses on Chatham Island that will rent you a vehicle . Do not expect the flashest and latest in rental cars though . The cars " will " be warranted and safe , but they wo n't be exceptionally " flash " . Chatham Motors have a range of nice rental vans available as well and they provide pretty good service for both visitors and locals .
