The future of the peace process in Israel " The future is only peace . The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for . " Shimon Peres image : David Shankbone . Mr. President , as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel , do you still think that there is a future to the peace process ? The future is only peace . The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for . Why do I say peace ? Because when you look historically , at the development of humanity , most of our lives we are living on the land . The history is written with red ink . The reason for it is because people were fighting for our land , either defending it or extending it , because that was the main source . The land , the natural resources , the markets , all these go together . The minute the land was replaced by science , what is there to fight about ? Armies can not conquer science . Customs can not check what a scientist has in his mind , they can see what he has in his pocket but not what he has in his mind so it ’s uncontrolled ; it means that borders are n’t important and distances are n’t important . How do you approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when , in the end , they do n’t want Israel to exist . How do you come to an understanding to make peace possible ? Well , what is the problem ? I mean , is the problem national , say between Jews and Arabs ; or is it a matter of generations between an old age and a new age ? You see , the terrorists are protesting against modernity . They think that modernity may endanger their tradition . They are simply afraid and hate modernity . They consider modernity as their enemy , but then they have two problems . First of all , can they exist on tradition ? They can not . Sooner or later they will have to enter the new age . All the talks about nationalities , etcetera , well , the new age has very little patience for history . History is becoming more and more irrelevant . How do you feel about that ? Well , I distinguish between two histories , the spiritual and the material . Or the history of events and the history of values . The history of values is okay because wisdom is ageless ; it does n’t grow old , like material . But events are totally unimportant for 2 reasons . First , the event is unimportant . Tell me , what events is today important such as how many elephants Hannibal had on the Alps , when you can have helicopters ? Why should I bother my children with all this nonsense ? What sort of a nose did Cleopatra have ? God , I do n’t know ! You can invite people to war over noses , but nobody will go to fight for noses any more . On the other hand , there are already machines that can replace our memory . Why should I bother my child with memory when he can buy a computer that will remember everything you asked him to remember ? The waning importance of history Is n’t the answer to that question that wise decisions are made with a basis from memory ? Although a computer can have … No , no . Forget memory . Look , the new age is unprecedented . When something is unprecedented , it means it does n’t have a past , does n’t have a history . It ’s totally oriented on the future . And whoever dwells in the past , does n’t understand the future because the past is full of prejudices , of commitments . It arrests us . And then you say you wo n’t commit a mistake , so you ’ll commit new mistakes . It does n’t matter . `` I say brains is the greater producer of wealth , not oil . It ’s limitless , and you ’ll see that the GNP of Israel is very close to the Saudis ’ . So they are 3 times larger than us and they have all the oil in the world . We have brains . " — Peres , on whether the Arab states ' oil wealth will eclipse Israel 's prominence in the region . What about the adage , “ Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it ” ? So they will make new mistakes . Mistake is inevitable as long as there are human beings . But you can not repeat mistakes because the world is not built on repetition ; it ’s built on mutation . Do n’t you think Darfur is repetition ? I think Darfur is , again , the last , or among the last battles between old and new . What are they fighting for ? What are they killing killing killing over ? They do n’t carry futures . It ’s not a mistake . It belongs to a past . It does n’t have a moment . I am sure that the reasons for war are over , even though still there are wars which are an inertia from the past , a continuation that does n’t make sense . I ’m answering your question . The problem is how to enable the whole world to enter the new future , including the Arabs . And there are already Arabs who did it . Look at Turkey , who is knocking on the doors of the united Europe . Why ? It ’s not a geographic endeavor , it is an intellectual endeavor . They say you can be Muslim and modern .
