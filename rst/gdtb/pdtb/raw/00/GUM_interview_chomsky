Interview with US political activist and philosopher Noam Chomsky Saturday , April 4 , 2009 Political activist and philosopher Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky is a professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Linguistics and Philosophy . At the age of 40 he was credited with revolutionizing the field of modern linguistics . He was one of the first opponents of the Vietnam War , and is a self - described Libertarian Socialist . At age 80 he continues to write books ; his latest book , Hegemony or Survival , was a bestseller in non-fiction . According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index Professor Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar of all time . On March 13 , Professor Chomsky sat down with Michael Dranove for an interview in his MIT office in Cambridge , Massachusetts . On NATO I just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent NATO actions and the protests coming up at the 60th NATO conference , I know you ’re speaking at the counter-conference . Could be I give so many talks I ca n’t remember . On the NATO conference , well I mean the obvious question is why should NATO exist ? In fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed , but now why should it exist . I mean the theory was , whether you believe it or not , that it would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression , that ’s the basic doctrine . Well there ’s no defense against Soviet aggression , so whether you believe that doctrine or not that ’s gone . When the Soviet Union collapsed there had been an agreement , a recent agreement , between Gorbachev and the U.S government and the first Bush administration . The agreement was that Gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession : he agreed to let a united Germany join the NATO military alliance . Now it is remarkable in the light of history , the history of the past century , Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia , twice , and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance , centered in the most phenomenal military power in history , that ’s a real threat . Nevertheless he agreed , but there was a quid pro quo , namely that NATO should not expand to the east , so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone . And George Bush and James Baker , secretary of state , agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east . Gorbachev also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region , but the U.S would n’t consider that . Okay , so that was the basis on which then shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed . Well , Clinton came into office what did he do ? Well one of the first things he did was to back down on the promise of not expanding NATO to the east . Well that ’s a significant threat to the Soviet Union , to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union , it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity , not much but some . So they rescinded their pledge not to use nuclear weapons on first strike , NATO had never rescinded it , but they had and started some remilitarization . With Bush , the aggressive militarism of the Bush administration , as predicted , induced Russia to extend further its offensive military capacity ; it ’s still going on right now . When Bush proposed the missile defense systems in Eastern Europe , Poland and Czechoslovakia , it was a real provocation to the Soviet Union . I mean that was discussed in U.S arms control journals , that they would have to regard as a potential threat to their strategic deterrent , meaning as a first strike weapon . And the claim was that it had to do with Iranian missiles , but forget about that . Take say on Obama , Obama ’s national security advisor James Jones former Marine commandant is on record of favoring expansion of NATO to the south and the east , further expansion of NATO , and also making it an intervention force . And the head of NATO , Hoop Scheffer , he has explained that NATO must take on responsibility for ensuring the security of pipelines and sea lanes , that is NATO must be a guarantor of energy supplies for the West . Well that ’s kind of an unending war , so do we want NATO to exist , do we want there to be a Western military alliance that carries out these activities , with no pretense of defense ? Well I think that ’s a pretty good question ; I do n’t see why it should , I mean there happens to be no other military alliance remotely comparable — if there happened to be one I ’d be opposed to that too . So I think the first question is , what is this all about , why should we even be debating NATO , is there any reason why it should exist ? Labor actions as a revival of the Left We ’ve seen mass strikes all around the world , in countries that we would n’t expect it . Do you think this is a revival of the Left in the West ? Or do you think it ’s nothing ? It ’s really hard to tell . I mean there ’s certainly signs of it , and in the United States too , in fact we had a sit down strike in the United States not long ago , which is a very militant labor action . Sit down strikes which began at a significant level in the 1930’s were very threatening to management and ownership , because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management , and probably doing a better job . So that ’s a frightening idea , and police were called in and so on . Well we just had one in the United States at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory , it ’s hard to know , I mean these things are just hard to predict , they may take off , and they may take on a broader scope , they may fizzle away or be diverted .
