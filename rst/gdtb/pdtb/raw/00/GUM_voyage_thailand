Respect Thais are a polite people and , while remarkably tolerant of foreigners gallivanting on their beaches and with their women , you ll find that you will get more respect if you in turn treat them and their customs with respect . The wai Ronald McDonald showing how it 's done The traditional greeting known as the wai , where you press your hands together as is in prayer and bow slightly , is derived from the Hindu cultural influence from India , and still widely practised . Among Thais , there are strict rules of hierarchy that dictate how and when the wai should be given . In brief , inferiors salute superiors first . You should not wai service people or street vendors . The higher your hands go , the more respectful you are . You will also often see Thais doing a wai as they walk past temples and spirit houses . As a foreign visitor , you are not expected to know how to wai , nor to reciprocate when wai'd to ; while you 're unlikely to cause offense if you do , you may well look slightly strange . If somebody makes a wai to you , a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions , and for business , most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway . Dress Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people . You will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return . This translates in many ways , even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets . While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners , Thais respond more positively to well - dressed Westerners . Traditionally , Thais are modest and conservative dressers . At a minimum your clothes should be neat , clean , and free from holes or tears . Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women , except that you should avoid clothing showing a lot of skin . Pants are preferable to shorts , blouses should have capped sleeves , and if tank tops are worn , the straps should be thick ( i.e. , not spaghetti straps ) . Thai men generally wear pants , and most Thais view an adult man wearing shorts as fairly ridiculous ; shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren . Men 's shorts should be knee length or more , if worn at all . Taking off one 's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette , and this may even be requested at some shops . Wear shoes that slip on and off easily . Flip - flops , hiking sandals , and clog - type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand ; only in the most top - end establishments are shoes required . It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand ; your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs . For men , ankle - length pants are mandatory ; on top , t - shirts are acceptable , though a button - front or polo shirt would be best . Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts ; you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle - length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops . Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate , as are short skirts . The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors , so even if you see a local in shorts it 's not OK for everyone . Topless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches . At beaches which are primarily Thai visitors however , this is not advised . Religion Buddhist prayer flags , Wat Arun , Bangkok Monks are an integral part of Buddhism in Thailand , and Thai men are generally expected to spend a certain amount of time living as a monk at least once in their lifetime . Buddhist monks are meant to avoid sexual temptations , and in particular they do not touch women or take things from women 's hands . Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you . Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands . Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up , or place it on a special cloth he carries with him . Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman who will accept things from women merit - makers on their behalf . Theravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations and as such , are not allowed to touch money , so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures . Therefore , should you wish to donate to a monk , you should only offer food , and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple . Those monks that accept money are almost always fakes .
