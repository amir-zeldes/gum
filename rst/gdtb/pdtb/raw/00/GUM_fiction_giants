The Valley of Giants I had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the heart of the city . I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie . And after the war , I had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills . I had one granddaughter who survived the war . I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio . She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous . The young were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully . So it was a city of grandmothers . And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah - jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants . We all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed . “ We live in the modern era ! ” she cried . “ You should be ashamed of yourself ! " The traveler stood up from the table . She was bony and rough - skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot . Her eyes were veined with red . “ Nonetheless , ” the traveler said , and she walked out . They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler . To find anyone still proud , anyone who believed in giants or shame , was hilarious . The air of the bar was acrid with triumph . Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight . But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets . The smell of fish oozed from the docks . Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters . I caught her at her door . She invited me in for tea and massage . Her limbs were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country . She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented . A heady smell . In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone . I hurried home . My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble . My house was empty and cold . I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife . I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting . That granddaughter : her parents both worked in the vineyards , and when she was a child , she would play in my courtyard in the after - noons . When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , she refused to cry . She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she could n't — like tie knots , or catch a chicken .
