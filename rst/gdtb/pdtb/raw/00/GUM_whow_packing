How to Pack Your Possessions When Moving Even if you ca n't wait to live in your new house , curb your enthusiasm and resist the urge to cram all your possessions any which way into boxes . Steps Pack one room at a time if possible , and start with items that are least often used . Write down a list of everything you are packing , in particular if it 's valuable . Books , CDs , expensive clothes . Also , take note of which item is in which box . Use sturdy boxes . Fill the box to the brim and seal the lid . That way , you can easily stack boxes on top of one another . Tape the bottom of the box securely so that it does n't give way . Never fill a box until it is so heavy that you ca n't lift it safely . Spread the heavy items over a few boxes . Balance boxes with lighter items like towels or soft toys . Pack the lighter items on top . Use bubble wrap or newspapers when packing fragile items . However , newsprint may smudge so use newspaper selectively . Clean paper can be purchased cheaply from moving supply stores . Mark boxes . Boxes should be marked " Fragile " and " This side up " to prevent mishandling . Label each box clearly and which room it belongs to . Write on the sides of the box as well . Pack a separate box of essentials you may need for the first night at your new house . Include items like toiletries , toilet paper , bottled water , snacks and a change of clothes in case you can not unpack everything in time . Tips Do n't label boxes with contents if the contents are valuable . Instead of writing " Silver Service - Fragile " you should write something that makes it sound less theft inviting while showing the fragile nature of the contents . Example : " Mom 's old dishes " instead of " Fine China " Tape is cheap . Use lots of it . Close box bottoms well . Get masking tape or packing tape and tape screws and other little things that came out of something back against it . You 'll want to find the right screw reassemble something without having to pick it out of 100 others when you get there .
