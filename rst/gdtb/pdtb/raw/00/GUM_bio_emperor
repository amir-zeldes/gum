Emperor Norton Joshua Abraham Norton ( c. 1818 – January 8 , 1880 ) , known as Emperor Norton , was a citizen of San Francisco , California , who in 1859 proclaimed himself " Norton I , Emperor of the United States " . He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be " Protector of Mexico " as well . Born in England , Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa . After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848 , he sailed west , arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849 . Norton initially made a living as a businessman , but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice . After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract , Norton 's public prominence faded . He reemerged in September 1859 , laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States . He had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him ; nevertheless , he was treated deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented . Though some considered him insane or eccentric , citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay . Long after his death , similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube , and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge " The Emperor Norton Bridge " . On January 8 , 1880 , Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment . Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral . Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain , Robert Louis Stevenson , Christopher Moore , Morris and Goscinny , Selma Lagerlöf , and Neil Gaiman .

On September 17 , 1859 , he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city , proclaiming himself " Emperor of these United States " : At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States , I , Joshua Norton , formerly of Algoa Bay , Cape of Good Hope , and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S. F. , Cal. , declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U. S. ; and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested , do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall , of this city , on the 1st day of Feb. next , then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring , and thereby cause confidence to exist , both at home and abroad , in our stability and integrity . — NORTON I , Emperor of the United States . The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin . Norton would later add " Protector of Mexico " to this title . Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21 - year " reign " over America . One of Norton 's undated proclamations In his self - appointed role of emperor , Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state . After assuming absolute control over the country , he saw no further need for a legislature , and on October 12 , 1859 , he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress . In it , Norton observed : ... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice ; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring , caused by mobs , parties , factions and undue influence of political sects ; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled . Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt 's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to " remedy the evil complained of " . In an imperial decree the following month , Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress : WHEREAS , a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City , in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last , declaring the said Congress abolished ; WHEREAS , it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with ; NOW , THEREFORE , we do hereby Order and Direct Major - General Scott , the Command - in - Chief of our Armies , immediately upon receipt of this , our Decree , to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress .
