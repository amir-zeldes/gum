The thousands of cosplay outfits on parade around the various halls offered a tremendous cross-section of genres and eras of pop culture . The majority of outfits involved at least some elements made from scratch , a fantastic display of craftsmanship . Of the thousands , Wikinews spoke with a cosplayer going by the name " The Katherinator " . She was outside the building in the gardens , waiting for a photographer she had arranged to shoot her new Epic Mickey costumed character - style outfit . With shoes as wide as a forearm , and a rigid torso of carved foam , she remained exuberant even when caught in the traffic between halls , many hours into wearing the outfit .
