Frank Messina : An Interview with the ' Mets Poet ' Wednesday , October 3 , 2007 You have received a good deal of attention recently . Even though I 'm not Michael Jackson or somebody , when people come up to me and introduce themselves and say , ' Hey Frank , my name is John , ' I say , ' Hey John , my name is Frank ' and they laugh . It 's a funny phenomenon . What goes through your head when that happens ? I understand it . I 've gone to readings and concerts . I look at it as human interaction . Over the years I have performed in 32 countries and 40 states . I 've been doing this professionally since I was in my twenties , and before that since I was sixteen doing little tidbit poetry readings in coffeehouses . The band I started in 1993 , Spoken Motion , received a lot of recognition as a spoken word band born out of the New York spoken word scene . I worked with some great musicians and performed around the world . I remember signing my first autograph to a kid when I was 25 years old . As time went on , I came out with books and CDs , and I became used to that kind of thing . To me , the ultimate feeling of success as an artist , is to move somebody enough where they thank you . When someone comes up and says , ' Frank , thank you , your work is great . " You have a long career in poetry , but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets - inspired work . How do you feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work ? It 's ironic . Some of the greatest poetry has been born out of failure and the depths of adversity in the human experience . Walt Whitman , the first great American poet , wrote about the Civil War . He went looking for his brother , George Whitman , after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South . When he started out his poems were about beating drums , and blow , bugle , blow . Real patriotic . Then he started to see the real horrors of war . He was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time . Eventually when he found his brother he had resolution . I experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer . I loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero . I turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now . When I wrote my 9/11 - related poems , that was true adversity . I realize baseball is just a game . Can you recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now ? This was a piece that the Times only quoted one stanza , but it 's about preparation for a battle , and being prepared to either rise to the occasion , or go down : Do you know what it 's like to be chased by the Ghost of Failure while staring through Victory 's door ? Of course you do , you 're a Mets fan caught in a do - or - die moment in late September at Shea As one that 's battled hard through many a broken dream Let me say , " in order to rise to the occasion you must be willing to go down with the ship " , Have no fear , no hesitation , for Winning shall be it's reward ! Do n't let them get in your head ! you 've kept it up this long You 're a Mets fan in late September and you ll fight til the glorious end Cheer the team today ; ( your boys in orange and blue ) Let them hear you shout as they fight for what 's mightily due ( copyright Frank Messina ; reprinted with permission ) " Sports fans are n't known as patrons of poetry . Have you had interaction with " new readers ' through your Mets work ? This one person who I never met took a picture of me and sent it to me in an e-mail . The e-mail said , ' Frank , I have never bothered you during the game , but I just wanted to say thank you for your work and thank you for making some sense of the successes and failures and I wish you much success with your work . ' Last year in my section at the stadium I had a banner that read We Know ' . That 's all it said . Then earlier this year these shirts started to come out that said , " Poet says We Know " . It was amazing . We did n't use the banner this year , though , because we did n't know . The team was n't so far ahead that we knew . Last year we just knew we were going to the playoffs ; we knew we were going post-season . This year we were n't sure . We were walking on eggshells . There was a woman , a season ticket holder and a die hard fan . She was staggered by the loss last year to the Cardinals . Last year she came up to me during one of the games late in the season ; she was so happy we were going to the post season . By that point we had clinched it . She handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug . With tears in her eyes she said , " Thank you , Mets Poet , thank you . " It 's cool ... it 's like another family . Moments like that must make you realize you have touched people who are n't normally touched by poetry . It 's opened up a new fan base , so to speak . For the last year SNY has broadcast footage of me with my poems , so quite a few fans known about the " Mets Poet ' . I have never called myself that , by the way . The back of my jersey says " The Poet ' because growing up that was my nickname . My brother was a runner and they used to call him The Birdman -- Birdie -- and they called me The Poet . It was a natural thing , but I never coined myself as ' The Mets Poet . '
