Athens ( Greek : Αθήνα , Athína ) , is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants . It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece , and therefore of Western civilization . Understand Old Athens The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis . The legend says that the King of Athens , Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom ( c. 1230 BC ) . This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland , but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility . By the 7th century BC , social unrest had become widespread , and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code ( hence " draconian " ) . When this failed , they appointed Solon , with a mandate to create a new constitution ( 594 ) . This was the great beginning of a new social revolution , which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes ( 508 BC ) . During the Middle Ages , Athens experienced a decline , but re-emerged under Byzantian rule . Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades , actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period . However , this fruitful period was short - lived , as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire , only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece . Modern Olympic Games Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games . While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike . Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics ( from new freeways to light rail systems ) , the city 's historic center underwent serious renovation . Most notable among the city 's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city 's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts . The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD . It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia , but quite interesting . Architecture Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State . Although it had a prestigious past , the city 's political , economic , and cultural importance had declined over the centuries , leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times . With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens , architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins , with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings , large city squares , green spaces , and wide avenues , making a conscious , decisive turn from the city 's Ottoman past . The city regained its importance in Greek civilization , and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city , with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation 's past . The 20th century however , marked the rapid development of Athens . The city suffered minor damage during WWII , and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed , as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized . In the 1960s and 1970s , many 19th century neoclassical buildings , often small and private , were demolished to make way for office buildings , often designed by great Greek architects . The city also expanded outward through rash development , particularly towards the west , as its population grew by absorbing job - seekers from the provinces . With the onset of the automobile , public officials reduced the city 's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s . By the late 1980s and early 1990s , the city 's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and , coupled with the country 's new found remarkable prosperity , large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades . Over the course of the next 15 years , money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects , the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings , the gentrification of the city 's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city 's coastline . The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city 's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts ; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city . Athens today is ever evolving , forging a brand new identity for the 21st century . Climate Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens . Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves , but this rarely happens . Winter is definitely low season , with the occasional rainy or snowy day , but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists . Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads , on most sunny days the skies are azure blue . The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave . The government 's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin .
