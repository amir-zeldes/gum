Phoenix Phoenix is the capital of the state of Arizona as well as the most populous city in the American Southwest and sixth largest city in the United States . Founded in 1871 , it has become the region 's primary political , cultural , economic , and transportation center . At an elevation of 1100 ft ( 335 m ) , it is situated in the biologically unique Sonoran Desert . Over time it has merged with the neighboring cities of Scottsdale , Tempe , Glendale , Peoria , Chandler , and Gilbert to form the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area . Currently exurbs such as Apache Junction , Fountain Hills , Queen Creek , and Sun City are becoming part of this metropolitan area as well . Phoenix is extremely hot and dry in the summertime , so always have sunscreen with you ! Understand Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert ? The answer is , surprisingly , agriculture . The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large - scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century . The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture , which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages , whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day . White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century . The city 's name reflects its history as a city " reborn from the ashes " of the previous settlement . European - American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s , and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation - based agriculture . Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops , and for many years , intensive , year - round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy . Recent years are seeing a revival , and trendy hotels , bars , shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again . Warm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry , and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix . High - tech industry began to flourish after World War II , and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive . As a result , a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2014 estimate of 1,537,058 ( with the metro area estimated at 4,489,109 ) . Climate Phoenix has an arid climate with long , hot summers and very mild winters . It has the highest average temperature of any metropolitan area in the States . The weather varies enormously from one season to the next . While it 's not as cold as in the northern states during the winter , it does freeze sometimes , and temperatures in the 30s ° F ( that 's around or slightly above 0 ° C ) are not unheard of . In the summer , very hot and dry heat is the norm . On the hottest days , it can get up to 115 ° F ( 46 ° C ) or more . Monsoon rains with lightning occur regularly from July to September during the late afternoon and evening , occasionally overnight also . April is the most ideal month . In some neighborhoods , cicada insects make loud sounds from sunset to sunrise . Talk English is the dominant language in Phoenix . However , like much of the Southwest with a large Hispanic population , Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix . Spanish is a language often used for day - to - day discourse in many places , although English is the language of preference , especially when dealing with businesses and government .
