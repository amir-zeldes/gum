Am I doing that right so far ? Mhm . All the way down to that ? Mhm . I think . I do n't think I am . Do you ? And you 'd have to have that plus or minus . What ? I do n't know what I did to get that . Where did I get that square root of — um , x squared ? Because you brought this over here . You brought three over here , divided by three , and then you have x squared , so if you want to find x , you have the square root of x squared . I guess all I ca n't figure out is , what the square root of negative two thir – thi – two thirds is . Would that be , i square root two thirds ? i square root two o – over three . The whole thing would be over three . Well . No it could n't be . Square root of two thirds , yeah . But then you got the other one Nathan . Oh , gosh , hm . Leah . She snoozing on the floor ? Mhm . Not anymore , you woke her up . She 's doing the Karate Kid , Nathan . She 's like , ' leave me alone . Do I deserve this ? ' I mean how would you like it , when you 're laying in bed , somebody just grabbed your arm , started swinging it around ? I 'd probably just slap em . X squared equals one over the square root of that , the square root of that , x equals the square root of one . She 's not even looking at me . She 's just looking , like — I know . That 's what I 'm talking about . So , would that one be , square root of one half ? Mhm . It would ? Mhm . Yep . But do y' all have to do that , um , you have to like , have it where you do that , there 's no , um . Fraction under the – Under the , in the denominator ? I mean no fraction under the — Oh yeah . So then you just multiply , the whole thing by the square root of two , and you get the square root of two over two . Even for the top one ? Even for that one ? No . For — I 'm talking about for this one . Oh . All you do is like go , t- two over one . You have the square root of one . Like that , right ? Mhm . Since you have the square root of two on the bottom , to make that a square , you have to multiply by the square root of two . And then you get two , and you multiply the top by the square root of two , and you get , square root of two . What ? I wan na rewind it and hear that back again . Cause I sure did n't catch it the first time . You got the two , and you take the square root of two , and you get the negative two , which you take the square , and it comes to two . I 'm sorry . So , let 's talk about this slowly , as I write this down , as you 're saying it . Alright ? This is what we came out with . Right ? It 's — But put it as the square root of one , over the square root of two . Oh . And then you multiply that by the square root of two , over the square root of two . Right . Uh , is that what all those square root of twos are ? That 's what I was try — That 's what I was trying to say . Okay , I was wondering where all that , square root two , square root two . That 's what it was . Then right here you 'd get , square root of two over two . Mhm . See everything was square root two , over two , and two , Right , but then , what about this one ? On this one . Let me do this one . But , you have i — you have i square root of three , over square root of three . I mean z — i square root of two over three — square root of three . I ca n't even say it right . Over , do I have another i down here , or just the one i ? Um , no . Just one . Okay , three and square root of three , over square root of three , and you get — i square root of six . Yeah . Over three . Is that right ? I doubt it . I really do . I 'm not kidding . You ca n't — You ca n't multiply square roots like that , can you ? Square root of two , times square root of three , is square root of six , is it ? Yeah . Okay . Well , then that 's fine . Then that is right . Is n't that c- — you can do that . Yeah . Cause that 's the same way you 're multiplying there , square root of nine , that — and square root of nine equals three . Yeah , okay . Where 's the test ? There ai n't no telling . You have it . I mean I have it . Okay . The next one , is , five x , times x minus one . Is that it ? Um . Equals , two , times one minus x . Leah . Two times one minus x ? Yeah . And that 's easy , you can do that . Oh this is easy . X squared . Please say this will factor . Will it ? Nah , you do it . Well , I mean , that 's just wasting time . Cause if it 's not . Yeah . It does ? Mhm . One and negative two - fifths ? Mhm . And I can always put those back up into the top and , and see if they check . Right ? Let me just try the one ? Five , I got zero equals zero . Tha- – that 's right . And that 's one ? Yeah . Zero equals zero equals one . Okay .
