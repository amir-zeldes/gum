Final days Siméon Poisson reviewed Galois ' paper on equation theory and declared it " incomprehensible " . Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale , although he continued to spend time in political activities . After his expulsion became official in January 1831 , he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest , but this waned , as it seemed that his political activism had priority . [ 4 ] [ 7 ] Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations , which he did on 17 January 1831 . Around 4 July 1831 , Poisson declared Galois ' work " incomprehensible " , declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ; however , the rejection report ends on an encouraging note : " We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion . " [ 16 ] While Poisson 's report was made before Galois ' July 14 arrest , it took until October to reach Galois in prison . It is unsurprising , in the light of his character and situation at the time , that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter , and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier . Apparently , however , Galois did not ignore Poisson 's advice , as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison , and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel . [ 8 ] Galois ' fatal duel took place on 30 May . [ 17 ] The true motives behind the duel are obscure . There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it . What is known is that five days before his death , he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair . [ 7 ] Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie - Félicie Poterin du Motel , [ 18 ] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life . Fragments of letters from her , copied by Galois himself ( with many portions , such as her name , either obliterated or deliberately omitted ) , are available . [ 19 ] The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois , and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf . This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died . Galois ' cousin , Gabriel Demante , when asked if he knew the cause of the duel , mentioned that Galois " found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé , each of whom provoked the duel . " Galois himself famously exclaimed : " I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes . " [ 12 ] Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois ' biographers ( most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics ) , such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage - managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy . [ 14 ] As to his opponent in the duel , Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville , [ 13 ] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois ' first arrest . [ 20 ] However , Dumas is alone in this assertion , and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved . It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel 's " supposed fiancé " at the time ( she ultimately married someone else ) , but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture . On the other hand , extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent ( identified by the initials " L. D. " ) that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois ' Republican friends , most probably Ernest Duchatelet , who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges . [ 21 ] Given the conflicting information available , the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history . Whatever the reasons behind the duel , Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament , the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas , and three attached manuscripts . [ 22 ] Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament , " This letter , if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains , is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind . " However , the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated . [ 7 ] In these final papers , he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers . The Galois memorial in the cemetery of Bourg - la - Reine . Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave and the exact location is still unknown . Early in the morning of 30 May 1832 , he was shot in the abdomen , [ 17 ] abandoned by his opponents and seconds , and was found by a passing farmer . He died the following morning [ 17 ] at ten o'clock in the Hôpital Cochin ( probably of peritonitis ) , after refusing the offices of a priest . His funeral ended in riots . [ 17 ] There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral , but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque 's death , and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June . Only Galois ' younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois ' death . [ 23 ] He was 20 years old . His last words to his younger brother Alfred were : “ Ne pleure pas , Alfred ! J' ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à vingt ans ! ” ( Do n't cry , Alfred ! I need all my courage to die at twenty ! ) On 2 June , Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown . [ 17 ] [ 15 ] In the cemetery of his native town – Bourg - la - Reine – a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives . [ 24 ]
