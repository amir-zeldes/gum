Sensitive Canadian document found on rainy streets Friday , August 15 , 2008 A sensitive Environment Canada document was found wet on an Ottawa street by someone who gave it to the CBC today . The 131 - page document was found on Castlefrank Road in Kanata , Ontario in a rain - stained , tire - marked brown envelope by a passerby . The document which had the stamp Protected B on every page detailed various security vulnerabilities of the NEMISIS database which is used by officers to track and prosecute environmental law - breakers . If someone were able to shut the system down , or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information , it could affect the prosecution of the lawbreakers . The database was unveiled in 1999 as the National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence System . However , on the document , it referred to the database as National Enforcement and Emergency Management Information System and Intelligence System , adding the words " and Emergency " to the name . Protection B documents are the second lowest grade of classified government documents . Environment Canada spokesperson Julie Hahn said they apply to letters of complaint , criticism or injury , research or scientific notes and findings that do n`t have any conclusion , and Treasury Board letters , agendas and minutes that do n`t deal with subjects of national interest . Environment Minister John Baird has asked government officials how such documents that are supposed to be stored in " approved security cabinets " wound up on the street . " I 'm told two things : that it 's neither classified nor secret and that it 's stuff that could be available under access to information , " Baird said . Environment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani told CBC News the department will look into the incident . " We take document security seriously , " she said , but refused to give any more details about how the papers came to be on a road . Paul Dewar , an Ottawa New Democrat MP , said the combined security lapses raise serious questions about the government 's ability to secure sensitive documents . Dewar says that bureaucrats of the Conservative government have complained to him about document security to the point that they ca n`t share the information with their own colleagues . However , when a government document has been found on the streets , the government then says it was n't particularly sensitive . " This government is so consumed with control of information and secrecy yet they do n't seem to be able to get the fundamentals right , " Dewar said . The incident is a reminiscent of two other incidents . In March , a bundle of blueprints for a new headquarters for the military 's counterterrorism unit were found stuffed in the trash on a downtown street . In May , Maxime Bernier was forced to resign as Foreign Affairs minister after it became known that he left sensitive documents at the apartment of his then - girlfriend Julie Couillard who had ties to the Hells Angels biker gang .
