Cool . Alright folks . Well alreet , well alroot , well alright . By now I 'm sure you 're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here , but first , I would like to talk to you about these three items . I have here , some ice in a pan , water in this glass , and steam rising from this pot . Now , I would like to ask you , how these three things . Tell me please . How are they all alike . These three things . This ice here in this pan . This water in this glass , and the steam rising from this pot , just yell it out , we are informal here , yes . Correct . They are all forms of water . This ice here of course is water , I told you there was water in this glass , and you have all seen water boil at home , so you are familiar with steam . But now let 's try to figure out how they 're different , we 'll look at temperature , first . And the temperature of this water here , the ice , is , about uh twenty - four – woo- nineteen degrees . Very cold . The temperature of this w- water here , is sixty - four degrees , the temperature of this steam , is , I know it 's hotter than that . Yeah , it 's about a hundred and eleven degrees . Okay . Fahrenheit . Okay . Oh , and by the way guys , what do we call something that 's hard , like this ice here , or a table , or a rock ? We call it a ? Solid . Very good . You should g- — you should be a choir . You should go out on the road there , like , yeah . We are . Y- — oh well , I 'm glad to meet you . Please give me your itinerary after the show . Yes . Yes . Of course we call it a sholids . A solid . And a solid has one shape . The shape that it starts out with . And what do we call something that you — that you can splish splash ? Take a bath in . Anything wet like soda or milk . Liquid . You 're not gon na let me finish , are you ? Yes , we call it a ? Liquid . Very good . And a liquid can change its shape , to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in . And finally , what do we call something that 's loose , and floating around like this steam here ? Or a cloud , or the air we breathe , we call it a ? Gas . Correct . A gas . And a gas completely fills whatever shape container you put it in . And so , how do you get water to change , from a solid , to a liquid , to a gas , and back and forth ? Add energy . Woo . I like the way he expressed that . Never before have I heard it , add or subtract energy , or , heat , change the temperature , basically . Correct ? Alright . Well folks , now I 'm going to show you something else that happens when you change the temperature , and that 's where these balloons come in . I have here a number of balloons , but , l- let 's see how many of these balloons , I can fit , into this little itty - bitty container here . Well , everybody count together . This would be ... There 's a- in there . You think , well , okay , w- th- th- , I 'm glad I never saw d- Citizen Kane with you . Rosebud is a sled . Okay . Well , let 's all count together folks , that was ? One . One . Very good . One balloon going into the little container here . And this would be ... Two . Two . Very good counting there . Two . Excellent . Two balloons going into the little container here . Ah , they 're not fitting in so easily . Oh no . So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here . Oh stop guessing at what this is . Let 's have some suspense here . Come on . Alright . And this would be ? Three . Three . Very good . Three balloons going onto the the little container there . Three balloons . Three , yes , the balloon trinity . And now , this would be ? Eight . Four . Four . Very good . At first he was confused , but then he figured it out . Everybody tell him what this is , it 's ... Seven . It 's four . Boy you people did n't watch enough Sesame Street as a child . This would be ? Five . Thank you very much , yes . Five swollen balloons . In . In . Down . Down . Ah , ah . Okay . And this would be ? Six . Six , good . And let 's do this uh , let 's add some complexities to this here , let 's do it in another language . In Spanish it would be ? Ocho . Seis . S- seis . N- ocho . Oh my gosh . I 'm afraid for our nation . Okay , well , and this would be ? Siete . Thank you . Seven . Right ? Seven . Okay . And finally , this would be ? Eight . Ocho . Eight , or ocho in Spanish , and uh huit in French , thank you very much . I thought you were telling me your breakfast . What you had for b- — But no , huit . Very good . Oh my gosh , eight balloons into this little container here , I bet you 're wondering r- how that happened . You popped two . There 's a hole in it . Well , there 's a hole , no , if you 're thinking there 's a hole , think again . Because , there 's no hole in the counter at all . Pull em out . You slowed down the molecules , Well – la duh dah dih duh duh , you 're getting a little ahead of me son . Let 's all figure it out together .
