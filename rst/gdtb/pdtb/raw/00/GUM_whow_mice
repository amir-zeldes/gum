How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally Having mice in your home is both a nuisance and a health hazard . They can cause property damage , create a mess , and produce unpleasant smells . In addition , repelling and removing rodents from your home can be a hassle if you do n't know what you are doing . It can also be dangerous if you use toxic chemicals and poisons . It 's a good thing , then , that there are some simple ways to effectively get mice out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisons . Method 1 Discouraging Mice Naturally Keep your home clean . Many times mice are drawn into homes on the search for food . If there is nothing to eat , mice will be less likely to stay . Keep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack . [ 1 ] Apply peppermint oil . Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent . The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it . It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning . It also gives the house a lovely smell , and is not toxic , unlike many synthetic chemical treatments . You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores . [ 2 ] Place a drop or two on a cotton ball . Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it . Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house , by doorways , or heat vents , etc. Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5 - 7 days , depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it . Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways . You can use the mint in cooking , as well as it serving a deterrent purpose . Use dried snake feces . Visit a local reptile center , zoo , or pet store and ask for some dried snake poo . You can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake . Place near entrances and in places where mice seem to go . This will keep mice away . [ 3 ] Be sure to keep the feces out of the reach of children and pets . Zap mice with ultrasonic sounds . There are electronic units sold that emit an ultrasonic beeping sound that rodents hate . They should be available at your local home improvement store or online . These work only on a single line of sight , so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking . The units may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them . [ 4 ] Use a commercial , organic deterrent . Many companies that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons . Many of these products use natural ingredients , such as peppermint , that are known to be disagreeable to mice . They will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied . These products should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center . If you want a specific product , try doing a online search to see where it is available locally . Get a cat . A house cat can take care of the problem . Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse . Just be aware , not all cats have enough energy , interest or training to hunt mice . Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser . Well - food indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy , and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless . Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter , and generally do not test for this . Sometimes this information is available , but usually not . While many mousers are great pets as well , not all are . " Barn cats " may not be socialized well with humans , although used to hunting mice for food . Even if you do not have a cat , you can use used kitty litter to deter mice . Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house . The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy . If you have a large infestation , a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it . However , once you eliminate the infestation , a cat will probably prevent reinfestation . [ 5 ] Put your trash cans far from your home . Mice smell garbage and get attracted to your house . If you keep the cans away from the house , they are less likely to take up residence in your home . Promote the nesting of birds of prey in your yard . Build a shelter box in your garden to attract some onto your property . This may take some time , but it 's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard . [ 6 ] Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards . A barn owl is the best . A family of barn owls can eat many mice in a night ! However , you might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box .
