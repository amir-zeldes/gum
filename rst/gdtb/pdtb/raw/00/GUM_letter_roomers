Dear 3 or 4 Roomers - ( class of '71 ) Tonight is Thursday , May 30th . The time is 10:55 P.M , and I 'm tired as hell . I spent the entire day at picnics + beach parties at P.A. , but I 'll try to make a little bit of sense . My First experiance with the 4 - room ( as it was this yr. ) was meeting my ROOMATES RUTH RASER , SALLY BROWNING AND karen HO , FROM Schenectady N.Y. , MYSTIC CONN. and HONG - KONG respectively . Things went on well for a while , but it takes some getting used to . Then around November Ruth had to move to a single because of bad grades - that 's one thing about this room , it can really hurt your grades - she moved upstairs to the 3rd floor , where there are 3 singles so the four - room became a 3 room for a while , until January , when the 3rd floor was condemned by some shitty building inspector . Dory Streett who had lived upstairs in a single became my new commate . We 've all existed so far but we 've been damn lucky , and have also worked damned hard . A few hints . First of all do n't talk back to Mrs. G. and you 'll have a good year . Adele , the maid , is so dumb that you 'll have loads of fun just giving her gas . voices from the 4 - room carry a lot farther than you think - you can tell this by listening from the bathroom . So be quiet , but do n't worry - Mrs. G never reports you to Core for being noisy or staying up , only for things like cutting Church or required crap . Unless they take them out this summer , you will notice 2 hooks in the ceiling of the outer porch . Sally + I , whose beds were out on the porch used them for hanging flashlights over our beds for studying ( just tie them to used nylons or SOMEthing ) IF you have A SMALL STUDY LAMP you DO N'T EVEN NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS . THE ONLY DANGER ABOUT AFTER LIGHTS STUDYING IS BEING REPORTED BY THE VICTOR OR PINKERTON GUARDS WHO PATROL THE CAMPUS TO PROTECT US FROM " TOWNIES " NEVER EVER LEAVE THE WINDOWS OPEN DURING SPRING TERM without SCREENS , or you 'll find a BEE 'S NEST IN YOUR BED LIKE SALLY DID THIS SPRING . WELL , ONE of MY ROOMATES is BITCHING LIKE CRAZY 'CAUSE she 's " TIRED , " so I CA N'T GO ON MUCH LONGER - WE 'RE HAVING A PARTY IN HERE TOMORROW NIGHT ( The last night of school ) so I guess I should try to get to sleep tonight too . so just remember to give this room all you can and remember that it ca n't be all that bad . Have a great 4 - room experience and a fantastic prep year - it 's supposed to be the best year to have , so TAKE ADVANTAGE . I 'M TRYING FOR FRENCH HOUSE NEXT YEAR , AND I HOPE I 'll make it , cause I hate ABBEY HOUSE . ( I ALSO HATE MRS. ABBOT , HOUSEMOTHER IN FRENCH HOUSE , BUT THAT 'S LIFE ) So , LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS , COME ON UP , AND VISIT , I 'M ROOMING with RUTH AGAIN Luv , Lucy Pope class of '71 P.S. IF THINGS GET DESPERATE , I 'M WILLING TO SELL MY GREEK + ROMAN HISTORY NOTEBOOK CONTAINING SECTIONS AND MAPS + NOTES FOR A SUITABLE PRICE . CONSIDER THIS OFFER LATER WHEN MISS MUCK DEMANDS 30 SECTIONS IN ONE NIGHT . ( I GOT AN A- and a B ! )
