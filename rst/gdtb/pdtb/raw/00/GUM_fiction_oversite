Oversite “ It does n’t hurt , Gram , ” Renata says . My sixteen - year - old daughter pulls up her T - shirt sleeve to show her bare arm , the skin summer brown and the muscle swelling slightly into smooth biceps , flawless . “ I had it done when I was little and see , you ca n’t even tell . ” My mother is sitting in the little examining room at the assisted living . Everything is white and hospital - like but there ’s no examining couch . There ’s just a desk , a little white table with two chairs and a scale . The doctor , a woman I do n’t know , is sitting in the other chair . My mother is bewildered , her face turned up towards me . She ’s got Alzheimer ’s . “ It ’s okay , Mom , ” I say . She wants to understand , I can see that . So I explain again . “ It ’s an implant that will let them know where you are , and how you are . It wo n’t hurt . ” Her eyes water constantly , now . In the time it takes me to explain she grasps and loses the words , grasps and loses phrases as they go past . She looks at me and then at Renata , who is smiling , and finally submits uncomprehendingly . We have worn her down . The doctor bares my mother ’s arm , where the crepey flesh hangs loosely on the bones . The doctor swabs her upper arm with antiseptic and says , “ I ’m going to give you something to numb it , okay ? ” To me the doctor says in her normal voice , “ It ’s just a little lidocaine . ” I do n’t like the doctor , but I do n’t know why . She is no - nonsense . She has professional hair , lightly streaked . This is no reason to dislike her . My mother winces at the injection and is surprised again . She looks up at me , at Renata . We are smiling , both of us . “ Okay , ” my mother says . What is okay ? I have no idea . We wait for a few minutes . My mother says , “ Is it time to go ? ” “ Not yet , ” I say . “ They ’re going to give you an injection . ” “ What ? ” my mother says . “ They ’re going to implant a chip . It will help them take care of you . ” I try to say it every time as if it was the first time I said it . I do n’t want to embarrass her . Her head swings around , from Renata to me to the doctor and then back to Renata . “ It ’s okay , Gram , ” Renata says . “ Renata , ” my mother says . The doctor has an injection gun and while my mother is focused on my daughter , she puts it firmly against my mother ’s arm and puts the chip in . “ Oh ! ” says my mother . It ’s another low - grade moment of horror , but I think about that particular time with my mother because Renata was there and we were united , she and I . So that ’s a good memory . I come back to it a lot . In the background , shining , is Renata , who is young and healthy and good , raising her arm to show her grandmother that the chip is nothing , nothing at all . The last two nights I have dreamed of dogs in trouble . I do n’t dream about Renata , although when the dreams wake me up , it ’s thinking about Renata that keeps me awake . The first night I dreamed of seeing a stray dog and not stopping to pick it up although it was wandering in an empty parking lot near a busy road . That was the first night Renata did n’t come home and it does n’t take Freud to figure out what that meant . Seventeen - year - olds sleep on friends ’ couches , I know . Or Renata might be sleeping in her car . The second night I dreamed that I was on a desert island and Sonia , our golden retriever , was with me . There was some horrible fate impending for Sonia and I had to kill her before something worse happened . I laid her down on some sticks . She trusts me , she ’s more my dog than anyone ’s , and she did n’t like it but for me she lay there . In my dream I told her , “ Stay , Sonia . Stay . ” She stayed because I held her there by looking at her , the way you can sometimes will a dog into submission . She stayed while I lit the fire . And then the horror of it all hit me and I said , “ Sonia , up ! ” And I woke up . That was last night , the second night Renata did n’t come home .
