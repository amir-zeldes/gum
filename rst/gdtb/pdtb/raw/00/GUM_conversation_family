Yeah . Do they have any kids ? Hm-m . Have they been married a long time ? I do n't think Kathy can have kids , she 's got a bad back . It sounds bad to me . She could n't – she could n't carry Laura . She had to be – Laura – She could hold her . As long as she did n't get up . Really ? Yeah sh- she weighed all of ten pounds you know . She 's all , heavy . She could – Well , maybe she does have quite a problem . M-mm . Some people d- could . I suppose . I mean , it 's not impossible . Yeah . But – Tend to believe it 's not as bad as sh- th- – How long have they been married ? Um , Year and a half ? I think , and , two years in November . Mm . What 's Bill doing now ? Hm . What are we in the process of ? Your Bill . Not Bill Wilson . My Bill ? Um , yesterday he was a carpenter . Your – He was a carpenter ? Yeah he put a floor in a barn . Oh really ? He put a floor in a barn . Well , he just fixed it , it had had one , and he was just replacing old rotten board . Oh . And stuff . I do n't know what he 's doing today . He was supposed to start baling hay , but I think they 're gon na let it sit another day , cause he did n't take his lunch . What does he do when he does n't take his lunch , come home ? No Doris feeds him . Eats there . Hm . Would she feed him every day ? Now explain all of this . I do n't understand what not taking his lunch has to do with baling hay . Well if he was gon na bale hay , they would n't come in for lunch . They would just eat – While they 're out there . Out there . Out in the field . I see . Yeah . Okay . If he did n't take his lunch every day , would she feed him every day ? Yeah , she does . Feed him . I mean – well , when they 're in the field , he has to take his lunch . That 's just part of the deal . But – Otherwise he 'll starve . Right ? No , otherwise he does n't get lunch . Well I know , that 's what starving is . Actually , I think that if she found out he come and did n't have a lunch , she 'd fix him one . Mm . Cause that 's what she does with other people . Mm . But all winter she fixes him lunch . Oh , cause they 're always close enough to – Actually it 's more of a dinner , because it 's – No lemon . I will go get you another one . N- that 's alright . She just remembered . No , it 's okay . Soon as I sat it down – sat it down I thought , no lemon . I knew it . Just – It – There 's not enough lemon there to bother me . Thank you . Okay . But it tastes so good with lemon in it . I do n't even like ice tea . Do you like hot tea ? Yeah , I love hot tea . But the winter has n't blasted cold enough for me yet . Do you put lemon in your hot tea ? I 'm going to today , cause I have a sore throat . Moi ? Or toi ? Well I answered – Schwa . I assumed it was me . I was talking to Beth , because she had the lemon . And the hot tea . I get it . Which you do n't have . I get it , yeah . Oh I know . So what about you , Sherry , are you gon na put lemon in your hot tea ? I do n't put lemon in my hot tea , You ever do ? I only do when I have a sore throat . I usually d- have , yeah , that 's good . Lemon , or lemon and honey is good . Yeah ? Now you wo n't be able to touch Jonathan . Just do n't tell him . Because you 're drinking lemon and honey ? She 's got a sore throat . No , because I have a cold . Oh . Well – Do n't tell him , or do n't tell Carolyn . Yeah . Yeah . And – Just do n't tell him , Martha Jean sat there – And – And told all about how , sick Barbara Jean was , when she was tiny , and – And ? That helped a lot , did n't it . Oh , Martha Jean , yeah . And what ? Well , Carolyn was – I do n't get it . Cause – I loved the little bit about the potty training . Eight months old and potty trained . She always says that . Oh my gosh . She told me the story of how uh , she trained all her kids by nine months . I 'd – Well what was it ? Now it 's gotten back to eight , hunh ? Oh Barb was at eight . Yeah , the boys were n't but – Oh well . They only – They did n't make it till nine . Who – who was it that 's – Hunh ? You know boys are slow ? Yeah I know . That said that , that 's not potty training , that 's mother training . Oh yeah . Doctor Spock . Doctor Spock . How about Captain Kirk ? What did he say ? No no Sherry . You 're an idiot . She 's trying . It 's Mister Spock , and Cap- I know . And Doctor Spock . Well , what was her story about Barb ? That everyone – That was – She was in the hospital three times . Carolyn was so affected by , or unaffected or whatever . With asthmatic bronchitis . With bron- — And so , how did Carolyn react ? Well – I – for some reason – She said thanks a lot , you know , because she was so worried about Jonathan . Oh sh- like oh , he 's gon na go back again in other words . I said but – And then she told her that , she did n't outgrow it until she was five or something ? She did n't have what ? We are all going " Barb did n't outgrow it ? " . Oh " outgrow it " . She was five or something ? Mm . Oh . So Carolyn was really happy . So , yeah because C- – Like " oh this is great news " . So then I said , " but look at Barb , she 's healthy now " , and Carolyn looked at her , and sort of looked away , and I thought , oh boy . Rude . Way to go Carolyn .
