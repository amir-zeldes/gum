Introduction Research on adult - learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] . Of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native - like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] . However , it is not enough to have attained such native - like levels . Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 . In fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] . Such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] . In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar : that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native - like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) , no such changes , or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native - like processing may be observed . Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom - like and immersion - like contexts . Previous Research We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes . ( Note that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s acquired by children ; for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) . The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] . These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] , with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] . Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure . Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following . A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] . Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] . Although attrition may take place within the first few years , some studies suggest that it then appears to level off , with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] . Higher levels of proficiency ( or exposure ) may be associated with less attrition [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] or even with no observed losses [ 21 ] . Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] . Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] . It remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] .
