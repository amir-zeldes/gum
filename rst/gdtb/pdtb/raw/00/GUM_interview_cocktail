[ The santorum neologism is ] offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . — Rick Santorum In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press , Rick Santorum compared legalizing same - sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality . Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator ’s last name , and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon . The term became a prominent result in searches online , and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google , Bing , and Yahoo! . Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon ; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google 's response ; " To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they ca n't handle . I suspect that 's not true . " Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview , saying , " It 's offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it .
