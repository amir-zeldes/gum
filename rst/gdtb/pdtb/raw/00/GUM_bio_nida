Eugene Nida Eugene A. Nida ( November 11 , 1914 – August 25 , 2011 ) was a linguist who developed the dynamic - equivalence Bible - translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of Translation Studies . Life Nida was born in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma on November 11 , 1914 . He became a Christian at a young age , when he responded to the altar call at his church " to accept Christ as my Saviour . " He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California in 1936 . After graduating he attended Camp Wycliffe , where Bible translation theory was taught . He ministered for a short time among the Tarahumara Indians in Chihuahua , Mexico , until health problems due to an inadequate diet and the high altitude forced him to leave . Sometime in this period , Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators , a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics . In 1937 , Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California , where he obtained a master 's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939 . In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana , California following the resignation of its founding pastor . Despite his conservative background , in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical ( clarification needed ) in his approach . In 1943 , Nida received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan . He was ordained as a Baptist minister . He married Althea Lucille Sprague , who died in 1993 . In 1997 , he married María Elena Fernandez - Miranda , a lawyer and diplomatic attache . Nida retired in the early 1980s , although he continued to give lectures in universities all around the world , and lived in Alpine , Arizona , USA ; Madrid , Spain and Brussels , Belgium . He died in Madrid on August 25 , 2011 aged 96 . Theories Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics . His Ph.D. dissertation , A Synopsis of English Syntax , was the first full - scale analysis of a major language according to the " immediate - constituent " theory . His textbook Morphology : The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism . It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises . His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence , also known as Functional Equivalence . For more information , see " Dynamic and formal equivalence . " Nida also developed the componential analysis technique , which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation ( e.g. " bachelor " = male + unmarried ) . This is , perhaps , not the best example of the technique , though it is the most well - known . Nida 's dynamic - equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text ( ST ) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page , and that meaning is self - contained within the text ( i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence ) . This theory , along with other theories of correspondence in translating , are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence , where Nida begins by asserting that given that " no two languages are identical , either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences , it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages . Hence , there can be no fully exact translations . " While the impact of a translation may be close to the original , there can be no identity in detail . Nida then sets forth the differences in translation , as he would account for it , within three basic factors : 1. The nature of the message : in some messages the content is of primary consideration , and in others the form must be given a higher priority . 2. The purpose of the author and of the translator : to give information on both form and content ; to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he / she may understand the full implications of the message ; for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation . 3. The type of audience : prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest . Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as " identical equivalents " in translating , what one must in translating seek to do is find the " closest natural equivalent " . Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence : Formal Equivalence ( F - E ) and Dynamic Equivalence ( D - E ) . F - E focuses attention on the message itself , in both form and content . Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry , sentence to sentence , and concept to concept . Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a " gloss translation " in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original . The principles governing an F - E translation would then be : reproduction of grammatical units ; consistency in word usage ; and meanings in terms of the source context .
