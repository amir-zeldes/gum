Miss Marcie Rickenbacker Abbot Academy Andover , Massachusetts 01810 May 30 Mum , Got your note today , many thanks , it was good to hear from you . What did you do with duck ? What am I going to do about that coed school in the north ? There are n’t very many good ones around , ( that I could get into ) . We ca n’t send stuff UPS because it ’s out of Boston and for some reason it ’s too much trouble . So ^ Today I sent a box of stuff home regular ( parcel post ) mail . Mrs. B put the postage on ( 80 ¢ ) but I just know it ’s not going to be enough . My exams start on Monday , Eng , French , then Math ( M. - Wed ) No his. of Art. exam ! Yeah ! ! ! Icky news for me – Brendan ( my love of this month ) is going to Antioch and they start June 30 . He ’s trying to go the next session ; Sept 29th , but wo n’t hear for another week or two . I ’m going to keep my fingers crossed , I was really planning on seeing him this summer . I hate to ask this , but … could you send me a measly five bucks ( only 5 smackers ) so I can get home . At this point I have just barely enough to get home , but I want to get something for Mlle. Arosa and then as always there ’ll be other petty expenses . Please … . Also tell Nance to cash the check if she has n’t already , it ’s fouling me up . I hope it stays nice , so I can study all morning outside . Today it was in the 80's . Say “ hello ” to all for me . Love always , Marcie See you soon !
