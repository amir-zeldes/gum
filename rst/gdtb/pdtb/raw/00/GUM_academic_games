The Use of Cognitive Digital Games in School : Contributions to Attention Daniela Karine Ramos dadaniela@gmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin Bruna Anastacio brunaanastacio@hotmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin Cognitive games involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition , while proposing the intersection between the sets of concepts , fun and cognition , for the improvement of cognitive functions . The attention is the main point made in this study , since it is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools . With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes , researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills ( Li , Polat , Scalzo , & Bavelier , 2010 ) ; on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously ( Dye & Bavelier , 2010 ; Feng , Spence , & Pratt , 2007 ) ; and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time ( Boot , Kramer , Simons , Fabiani , & Gratton , 2008 ) . Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student 's attention span at preschool age ( Rueda , Checa , & Cómbita , 2012 ) , to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children ( Miller & Robertson , 2010 ) , and to better performance of working memory ability ( Klingberg et al. , 2005 ; Thorell , Lindqvist , Nutley , Bohlin , & Klingberg , 2009 ) . Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention , because of its involvement in the regulation of thoughts and emotions , maintaining the performance of this process is very important , especially in school , where the child must acquire content in an environment full of countless distractors . The study in question focuses on the attention , proposing and evaluation in the context of the classroom . Thus , it suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom . The games have features like increasing challenges , rules that establish what can and can not be done , and involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills and win the game ( Kirriemuir & McFarlane , 2004 ; Prensky , 2005 ) . We aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a database , of the Escola do Cérebro , for monitoring and improvement of cognitive skills , highlighting the attention . The games involve challenges and rules involving the exercise of cognitive functions , especially the working memory , attention and capacity of solving problems . The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches . It collects the data based on the observation of the proposed interventions as well as interviews conducted with participating teachers and students to identify their perceptions of digital games ’ contributions to the learning process . Furthermore , before and after the implementation of the intervention , we performed a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention , as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed . The intervention consisted in the use of the Escola do Cérebro , using tablets in the classroom , daily for a period of five weeks . The sample consisted of 71 students of the Application School of Basic Education , Federal University of Santa Catarina , aged 7 and 9 years old ( M = 7.64 ± 1.12 ) , which were divided into two groups : participant and control . The first ( n = 31 ) participated in the intervention , the control group ( n = 40 ) was only evaluated using the test before and after the same time interval of interventions . The Escola do Cérebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database . The application allows visualization of the player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers . Students have their scores measured by four variables : time , speed , stability and accuracy . A statistical analysis was performed based on the application of the paired t - test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups . The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 ( 64.75 ) respectively , while the control group was 20.00 ( 42.65 ) . The result indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test , as well as a high dispersion , which reveals a variation in relation to the performance . In addition , students participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem solving , recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities , and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention . The teachers observed changes after the intervention , emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities , and in some students , improvement in the ability to sustain attention . From this , we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention .
