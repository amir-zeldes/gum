Coron Coron is in the province of Palawan , Philippines on Busuanga Island . It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations . Background Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga , and the name of a different , smaller island just offshore . The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving , and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world . In September 1944 , a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy . The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef . There are also attractions on Coron Island itself . There are many beautiful white sand beaches , mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife . Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations , and good for snorkeling , and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night . History The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago . They were a nomadic , seafaring people , living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture . Although they are now sedentary ( with the young using cell phones , etc. ) , they maintain many of their old customs , traditions and beliefs . Today , the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron . In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron . From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II , the municipality experienced the mining boom . Labor shifted from farming to mining . In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines . On September 24 , 1944 , a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay . To this day , about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world . In 1947 , large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron , and the town experienced another boom , a fishing boom . The population increased , as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners . On June 17 , 1950 , Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954 , Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan . On September 12 , 1992 , Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion . In the past , Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan . It remains a small , quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing , slowly but steadily , Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry . In the past decade , there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in , making tourism the major industry player in Coron today .
