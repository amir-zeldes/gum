I will tell a fucking detective . There are a bunch of them right around the corner from my motherfucking cell . I will tell them about all the shit you turn in stolen from your house . It was not my house . If you think you can get away with it , you are so fucking dumb . They will cuff you in the middle of your shift at Wal-Greens . You will not like it in here . So do yourself a favor drop the charges on me or else I will tell them all about your scam . They love to here about stuff like that . You did it all by yourself . Not me . It was all in your name .
