Proof If the sets S and T considered are empty or singletons , the theorem holds vacuously or trivially . Thus assume S and T each contain at least two elements . Let U = ( S , ⪯ S ) ∪ ( T , ⪯ T ) Define the following relation ⪯ on U : ∀ x , y ∈ U : x ⪯ y if and only if : x , y ∈ S : x ⪯ S y or : x , y ∈ T : x ⪯ T y or : x ∈ S , y ∈ T We claim that ⪯ is a well - ordering . First , we show it is a total ordering . Checking in turn each of the criteria for a total ordering : Reflexivity If x = y , they 're necessarily both in S or T simultaneously . Reflexivity then follows from ⪯ S and x ⪯ T being reflexive , as they are both orderings . Transitivity Let x , y , z ∈ U . If x , y , z ∈ S or x , y , z ∈ T simultaneously , then ⪯ is transitive by the transitivity of ⪯ S and ⪯ T . Suppose x , y ∈ S and z ∈ T . Let x ⪯ y and y ⪯ z . Then x ⪯ z because x ∈ S and y ∈ T . Suppose x ∈ S and y , z ∈ T . Then x ⪯ z also because x ∈ S and y ∈ T . Thus ⪯ is transitive . Antisymmetry Let x ⪯ y and y ⪯ x . If x , y ∈ S then x = y by the antisymmetry of ⪯ S . Likewise if x , y ∈ T . If x ∈ S and y ∈ T , then y ∈ S and x ∈ T as well . Thus x = y from the antisymmetry of ⪯ S or ⪯ T . Conclude that ⪯ is a total ordering . To show ⪯ is a well - ordering , consider a non-empty set X ⊆ U . Then either : X ∩ S = ∅ or : X ∩ T = ∅ or : X ∩ S is non-empty and X ∩ T is non-empty . In the first case , X ⊆ T , by Intersection with Complement is Empty iff Subset . Then X has a smallest element defined by ⪯ T . In the second case , X ⊆ S , also by Intersection with Complement is Empty iff Subset . Then X has a smallest element defined by ⪯ S . In the third case , the smallest element of X ∖ T is an element of S . Thus it precedes any element of T by the definition of ⪯ . The smallest element of X ∖ T , which is a subset of S , is guaranteed to exist by the well - ordering on S . This smallest element is then also the smallest element of ( X ∖ T ) ∪ T = X . Thus ⪯ is a well - ordering on S ∪ T . □ Consider the mapping : k : ( T , ⪯ T ) → ( U , ⪯ ) : k ( α ) = α Then k is strictly increasing , by the construction of ⪯ . Thus there is a strictly increasing mapping from T to U . From Strictly Increasing Mapping Between Wosets Implies Order Isomorphism , T is order isomorphic to U or an initial segment of U . Let Ix denote the initial segment in U determined by x , according to k . Note that Ix = Ik ( x ) , because k ( x ) = x . Suppose x ∈ S . Then Ix ⊆ S because ⪯ is a well - ordering . Thus there is an order isomorphism from T to Ix in S . Suppose x = min T , the smallest element of T . Then every element of S strictly precedes x , as x is in T . Also , x precedes every element of T , so Ix ≠ T . Thus there is an order isomorphism from T to all of S . Suppose x ∈ T and x ≠ min T . Then Ix defines an initial segment in T . Also , every element of S strictly precedes x , as x is in T . Thus there is an order isomorphism from an initial segment of T to all of S . The cases are distinct by Well - Ordered Class is not Isomorphic to Initial Segment . ■
