ANNABEL LEE . IT was many and many a year ago , In a kingdom by the sea , That a maiden there lived whom you may know By the name of ANNABEL LEE ; And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me . I was a child and she was a child , In this kingdom by the sea : But we loved with a love that was more than love — I and my ANNABEL LEE ; With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven Coveted her and me . And this was the reason that , long ago , In this kingdom by the sea , A wind blew out of a cloud , chilling My beautiful ANNABEL LEE ; So that her highborn kinsman came And bore her away from me , To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea . The angels , not half so happy in heaven , Went envying her and me — Yes ! — that was the reason ( as all men know , In this kingdom by the sea ) That the wind came out of the cloud by night , Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE . But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were older than we — Of many far wiser than we — And neither the angels in heaven above , Nor the demons down under the sea , Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE : For the moon never beams , without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE ; And the stars never rise , but I feel the bright eyes Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE ; And so , all the night - tide , I lie down by the side Of my darling — my darling — my life and my bride , In the sepulchre there by the sea , In her tomb by the sounding sea .
