The Onion : An interview with ' America 's Finest News Source ' Sunday , November 25 , 2007 How The Onion writes an issue This exclusive interview features first - hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter . See the collaboration page for more details . How do you decide on the stories ? We do everything backwards here . We start with the headline and then flesh out the story , as opposed to The New York Times , which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy . We start with a joke . We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside — a contributing core . We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred , come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff ; all fifteen of us . Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute . We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team , who adds the visual aspect to it . The editors punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition . So you do n’t have writers coming up with a story and headline , but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved ? Writers will occasionally write their own headlines , but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas , what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people ’s writing strengths are . We have some people who are great at politics ; some people we give all the war stuff to ; someone who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week — the entertainment stories . The headlines Editorial Manager Chet Clem and President Sean Mills . Image : David Shankbone It seems like some publications , like AM New York , always have a Britney Spears story ; is there anything similar with The Onion where they continually revisit a topic or person ? No , not necessarily . We are a little less reactionary . We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything . We ’ll hit the mainstream media ’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we ’ll hit characters in the entertainment world . We ’ll attack People Magazine ’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney . In an interview with Terry Gross , Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City that they had decided on not doing political humor and , in particular , hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes . They felt it was overdone , mean - spirited and not funny . Do your writers have similar rules of thumb ? We do n’t have any rules or known lines we wo n’t cross . We have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years , and those writers training the new writers as they come in . There is an understanding in the room . If it makes the room laugh , it probably ends up in the paper . One example is we ran an article a couple of years back that was , " No Jennifer Lopez News Today " . That was our reaction to all of the J - Lo stuff . We were n’t going to touch on her dress , or who she was dating . Just the fact that those were the lead stories for so many days , in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine . I think it ’s important we have an original take on those things . I think it ’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross . We do n’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle . There ’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle that exists on all the late night talk shows . The Onion has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes . We want an original take . If we choose to do something on J - Lo , it ’s going to be something like that , something less obvious . When you are going through the headlines , is it just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up ? It ’s the least amount of fun possible . Nah , I ’m kidding . It ’s actually more businesslike than you ’d imagine . It ’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh , but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now , so it takes a lot to make the room laugh . The best analogy I ’ve heard is when Rob Siegel , former editor - in - chief , likened it to wine tasting . It ’s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is , have we done anything like this , is it a unique take , what are other people doing . It ’s sort of like , " Hmmm ... that ’s hilarious . That ’s really really funny " rather than people falling off their chairs . It ’s more subdued than I think what most people would expect . It ’s more analytical and clinical ? Not all the time , but it ca n’t be a laugh a minute . Yeah , what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock , those are scripted writers rooms . Everything is funny there . There 's a lot of unfunny jokes that are told in a back room , that 's why they stay and die in that back room and do n’t go out in The Onion . If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes , do you eventually fire them ? That ’s why we are on the 10th floor to make sure they die when they get kicked out . It can be a real mess on Broadway . By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion , though , the odds are you are going to succeed because we make it pretty challenging . You go through quite a bit . You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record of writing stuff for us before you will be in that room on a daily basis . But if somebody wakes up one morning and suddenly no longer is funny , then yeah , head first , out the door as quickly as possible , and as sadistically as possible .
