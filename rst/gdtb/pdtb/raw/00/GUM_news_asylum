Over 900 asylum seekers rescued off Indonesian coast Monday , May 18 , 2015 On Friday , fishermen rescued over 700 asylum seekers whose boat sank , and the Indonesian Navy reportedly saved 200 more after they were found swimming along the coast of Aceh , Indonesia . Major general Fuad Basya , spokesman for the Indonesian military , said fisherman first noticed the people and a warship was deployed to retrieve them . The rescued members included Bangladeshis and Rohingya , a stateless minority of Muslims from Myanmar . Myanmar is mainly Buddhist and the United Nations rates the Rohingya among the world 's most persecuted groups . According to ABC News , Basya also believes the asylum seekers found in the water may have left the boat on purpose to be rescued to avoid being sent away from Indonesia waters . Malaysia and Indonesia have maintained a policy of turning away boats of migrants which , according to AFP , the Untied Nations and United States have both criticised . One Rohingya , Muhammad Amin , the first boat rescued on Friday was turned around twice , toward Malaysia by Indonesian navy and then toward Indonesia by Malaysian navy . Discussing his concern in a public statement , Malaysia 's Prime Minister , Najib Razak said , " We are in contact with all relevant parties , with whom we share the desire to find a solution to this crisis " . Thailand has recently cracked down on human trafficking , which has affected the routes by which people - smugglers transport migrants . The US State Department said John Kerry , the Secretary of State , contacted Thailand 's foreign minister over temporary housing for the Rohingya out at sea . Jeff Rathke , the State Department Spokesperson , said , " We urge the governments of the region to work together quickly , first and foremost , to save the lives of migrants now at sea who are in need of an immediate rescue effort " . Rathke also asked the governments of South East Asia not to turn away boats of people seeking asylum . Estimates suggest 8000 migrants may be currently at sea in the region .
