Wikinews interviews academic Simon Ličen about attitudes towards US Paralympics Saturday , November 16 , 2013 A Russian stamp for Paralympic Games in Sochi in 2014 On Thursday , with 110 days until the start of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi , Russia , Wikinews interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership , Sport Studies and Educational / Counseling Psychology at Washington State University Simon Ličen about attitudes in United States towards the Paralympics . Ličen has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents . Originally from Slovenia , he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission . He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team . Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ? Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society . It emphasizes consumerism , the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications , and reinforces , rather than changes , existing ideas related to gender , ethnicity and nationality . Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled . Although disability is not contagious , interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it . Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to . Other countries , including the ones you mention , have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society . Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act , many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity . What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ? The impact depends on a number of aspects . One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on . Will they be shown nationally or regionally , on NBC or on any of the company ’s multiple cable networks ? A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown . Remember that there is a nine - hour difference between Sochi and New York , and a 12 - hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast . So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night , and evening prime - time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time . So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears . A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated : will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics ? Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse ? Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity ? All in all , I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects ; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations .
