Welcome to the Techtonica curriculum ! Techtonica is a non-profit project of SocialGood that does free tech training and job placement for unemployed or underemployed folks . For more information , please see our website : Techtonica.org Program participants will learn to do full - stack web development using JavaScript . What bootcamps and Techtonica have in common is the fact that they are intensive training . However , bootcamps can be pretty passive classroom learning and they cost $ 15,000 + for the students . Techtonica aims to be more like the workplace to make the transition into the industry better — instead of having an instructor constantly guiding you ( which you wo n’t have in any software engineering job ) , you are given a general schedule of topics and assignments ( see our curriculum repo for an idea of the resources provided ) and you ’re expected to figure out what to do on your own or in collaboration with volunteers , mentors , tech groups , and other participants . We ’re making Techtonica ’s program as hands - on and project - based as possible to best prepare you for work in tech . Jump to Curriculum Table of Contents .
