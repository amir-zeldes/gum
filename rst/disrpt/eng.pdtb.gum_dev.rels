So would you take a minute to explain how a waiver or modification amounts to a waiver -- to a cancellation ?	Of course . So the Secretary identified various provisions in Title IV that govern the terms and conditions of student loans and also govern discharge and cancellation in other circumstances , as your question suggested . And I think the straightforward way to think about how the verbs map onto the Secretary 's action is that he waived elements of those provisions that contain eligibility requirements for discharge and cancellation that are inapplicable under this program and then modified the provisions to contain the limitations that he had announced as part and parcel of announcing this loan forgiveness . Now you had suggested that there 's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal , and that 's true , but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision , and so the HEROES Act is n't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute . I do n't think anything can be read into the fact that there 's no express reference to particular forms of relief because Congress was trying to broadly cover the field and ensure that the Secretary had the tools to respond to the national emergency with whatever relief might be necessitated . But , in an opinion we had a few years ago by Justice Scalia , he talked about what the word " modify " means , and he said modified in our view connotes moderate change . He said it might be good English to say that the French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility , but only because there 's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm . We 're talking about half a trillion dollars and 43 million Americans . How does that fit under the normal understanding of " modifying " ? So , of course , I recognize that in MCI , Justice Scalia 's opinion adopted a narrower understanding of that term , but I do n't read that opinion to set forth a universal meaning of " modify , " no matter the statutory context . And , here , of course , we have a broader phrase , " waive or modify . " It 's undisputed and the states are n't contesting that the ordinary meaning of " waive " means to eliminate an obligation in its entirety . And I think , if you look at that phrase in the context of the statute , that means that " modify " has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination . It would be really strange for Congress to say you can eliminate obligations altogether or tweak them just the littlest bit , but you ca n't do anything in between . Well , but it 's " waive " particular regulatory or statutory provisions . That 's right . That to me suggests a much more focused use of the word . Well , it 's " waive or modify " paired with the authority to do that with respect to any Title IV provision .

Yes , all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters . Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land , the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate . As of the last advisory , T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track . That is a Category 3 storm . The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours . However , there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path . Yes , it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land . This occurs for two reasons : As it moves over land , it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [ which is ] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface ; Increased friction - the ocean surface is much , much smoother than the land surface . Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat , which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain . As tropical cyclones make landfall , this energy source is cut - off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land . Yes , the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land . Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land . In the mean time , much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength . Yes . All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall . However , they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding . Phailin 's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland . Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength . However , and this is important , it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty .	20-45	46-415	Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ?

I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm . However , historically , there have been several events that should cause a societal response . Hopefully , we all learn from past mistakes . The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US $ 10 billion .

From all the press reports that I have read , the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed . The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past . The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate . Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out , which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations . Unfortunately , extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation . My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space . I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history . This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin . I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [ ... ] sponsored by the Indian government . Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region , the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives . I can not comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone . However , the news reports ( BBC etc. ) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding .

GUM_textbook_labor	8-127	128-568	When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service , workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output . In his observations of pin factories , Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day , but that a small business of 10 workers ( some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin - making ) , could make 48,000 pins in a day . How can a group of workers , each specializing in certain tasks , produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves ?	Smith offered three reasons . First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage . ( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . ) People have different skills , talents , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others . The particular advantages may be based on educational choices , which are in turn shaped by interests and talents . Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors , for instance . For some goods , geography affects specialization . For example , it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida , but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota . If you live in or near a big city , it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area . Whatever the reason , if people specialize in the production of what they do best , they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things , some of which they are good at and some of which they are not . Second , workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality . This pattern holds true for many workers , including assembly line laborers who build cars , stylists who cut hair , and doctors who perform heart surgery . In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better . A similar pattern often operates within businesses . In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products . Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines . For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average . However , if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year , then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks , and the average cost of production per car will be lower .	8-127	128-568	When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service , workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output .
