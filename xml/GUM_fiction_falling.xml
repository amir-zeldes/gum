<text id="GUM_fiction_falling" partition="test" author="Benjamin Rosenbaum" dateCollected="2017-09-13" dateCreated="2008-08-05" dateModified="2008-08-05" shortTitle="falling" sourceURL="http://smallbeerpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Rosenbaum_Ant_King.pdf" speakerCount="4" speakerList="#Protagonist, #Woman, #Derya, #CivicAgent" title="Falling" type="fiction" summary1="(human1) After hearing Derya rant about an 'airsurfer' woman that they see jumping off a futuristic bridge in Frankfurt, only to be saved by a cloud of flying mites, a protagonist pursues the woman and accepts her offer to be infected by her kiss with a virus which prevents mites from tracking people." summary2="(human2) You and Derya are on the 236th level moving sidewalk when you see an airsurfer jump from the Holbeinsteg bridge unnoticed by the city’s person-recognition mites and discuss how your reputation will be trashed from any association with airsurfers but you still meet her on the upside-down trading floor and she offers you the designer virus with a kiss." summary3="(human3) In a futuristic Frankfurt, the protagonist watches a woman “airsurf”, which involves infecting oneself with a designer virus that prevents the nanomites that run the city from stopping people from jumping off of bridges, discusses this behavior with their friend Derya who does not approve of it, and later accepts the woman’s offer to become infected with the virus." summary4="(human4) A protagonist watching mites in the sky spots a girl in a dress jump from a high-up building without being seen by the mites and learns that only airsurfers like her, due to being self-infected with a virus, can escape the mites before being asked by the girl if he would also like to be infected and fly." summary5="(human5) You are on the Holbeinsteg Bridge's moving sidewalk having a conversation with Derya, when you see a woman, who you think is a tourist, jumping off the sidewalk, who you see again eventually leaning in to give you a kiss.">
