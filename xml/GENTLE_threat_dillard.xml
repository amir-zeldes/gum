December 21, 2011)" type="threat" summary1="(human1) In this threat letter, Angel Dillard admonishes Dr. Means for carrying out abortions at the Harry St. clinic in Wichita, which are portrayed as killing children, arguing that other physicians will avoid associating with Dr. Means, and invoking the threat of a car bomb, picketing at home and at the office, loss of clientele and staff, as well as religious objections to abortion." summary2="(claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022; postedited) In a threatening letter to Dr. Means, Angel Dillard warns against opening an abortion clinic on Harry St., claiming people are monitoring his movements and suggesting violence, while citing religious objections and warning of professional/social consequences if he proceeds with his plans." summary3="(gpt4o) Angel Dillard warns Dr. Means against performing abortions at his clinic, citing social, ethical, and legal consequences, and threatening intense scrutiny and backlash from the community while urging him to reconsider his decision and instead use his medical practice for healing, underlining opposition with religious references and potential divine judgment." summary4="(Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) The writer threatens Dr. Means that protesting groups will aggressively target him if he goes through with plans to offer abortions at his Harry St. location, detailing potential consequences including physical harm and loss of reputation." summary5="(Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) Angel Dillard urges Dr. Means to reconsider his abortion plan, comparing it to unethical practices and comparing his potential actions to those that would haunt him, while warning of professional and personal consequences.">
