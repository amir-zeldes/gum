Douglas Babstock, et al." type="court" summary1="(human1) In an appeal by Atlantic Lottery Corporation against Douglas Babstock et al., attorney Julie Rosenthal argues that the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal's ruling that negligence can amount to wrongdoing in the absence of loss or injury is new and meets no unmet societal need, while contradicting precedent from the law of negligence, and should therefore be overturned." summary2="(claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) The case involves a motion to strike in Atlantic Lottery Corporation v. Babstock, where the key issue is whether the Newfoundland Court of Appeal erred in recognizing &quot;waiver of tort&quot; as a new cause of action allowing disgorgement without proof of causally-linked loss or injury." summary3="(gpt4o) In the case of Atlantic Lottery Corporation, Inc. v. Douglas Babstock et al., Julie Rosenthal argues for the appellant that the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal erred in recognizing a cause of action for waiver of tort without causally linked loss, claiming it contradicts established negligence law that requires actual damage for a tort to exist." summary4="(Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) The respondent's counsel Julie Rosenthal argues that waiver of tort is a new cause of action for disgorgement for wrongdoing and that the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal erred in recognizing it, as it is incompatible with the law of negligence and lacks internal coherence and specificity." summary5="(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) The argument presented by Atlantic Lottery Corporation seeks to invalidate the newly recognized cause of action for disgorgement of profits based on a breach of duty without causally linked loss, asserting it is incompatible with negligence law and lacks coherence, and requests the court to rule it unlawful.">
