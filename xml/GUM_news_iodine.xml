<text id="GUM_news_iodine" partition="dev" type="news" sourceURL="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australian_children_suffering_from_iodine_deficiency" dateCreated="2006-02-23" dateCollected="2016-09-19" dateModified="2013-05-06" speakerCount="0" speakerList="none" author="Wikinews" title="Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency" shortTitle="iodine" summary1="(human1) A 2006 Australian study has shown that almost half of all Australian children suffer from mild iodine deficiency, which can cause health problems especially for children and pregnant women, and is probably due to the replacement of iodine-containing sanitisers in the dairy industry and the lack of iodized salt in Australia." summary2="(human2) In this news article from February, 2006, Professor Cres Eastman says that iodine deficiency in Australia, experienced by all citizens including pregnant women and children, can lead to serious health problems including brain damage, while Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand says they are working on safely including more iodine in the food supply." summary3="(human3) This news article from February 23, 2006 indicates (based on a medical survey of schoolchildren) that iodine deficiency is a hidden health issue affecting nearly 50% of primary school aged children in Australia, and it and relays commentary and suggested remedies to the issue from the director of the survey, Professor Cres Eastman" summary4="(human4) A news report dated Thursday, February 23, 2006 discusses the results of a medical study which found that Australian children are iodine deficient, a condition which can lead to serious health problems, and explains that the director of the study Professor Cres Eastman recommends to iodise all edible salt in order to fix the problem." summary5="(human5) In February 2006, results from the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient, which can lead to serious health problems like brain damage, stunted growth, and deafness, and thereby, prompted calls for mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia.">
