<text id="GENTLE_poetry_annabel" partition="train" author="Edgar Allan Poe" dateCollected="2022-11-12" dateCreated="2000-01-01" dateModified="2000-01-01"  shortTitle="annabel" sourceURL="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Late_Edgar_Allan_Poe/Volume_2/Annabel_Lee" speakerCount="0" speakerList="none" title="Annabel Lee" type="poetry" summary1="(human1) This poem tells of the strong childhood love of the narrator and the beautiful Annabel Lee many years ago in a kingdom by the sea, which led the envious angels of heaven to chill and kill her via a wind out of a cloud at night, though their souls cannot be dissevered and the narrator continues to dream of her and feel her bright eyes." summary2="(claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) In this poem, the speaker mourns his childhood love Annabel Lee, who was taken from him by jealous angels and death in a kingdom by the sea, yet their love endures beyond death as he lies beside her tomb, forever connected to her soul." summary3="(gpt4o) In this poem, the narrator mourns the loss of his beloved Annabel Lee, a young maiden from a kingdom by the sea, whose love shared with him was so profound and envied by angels that it led to her untimely death, but he remains eternally connected to her soul, visiting her sepulchre by the sea as the moon and stars remind him of their enduring love." summary4="(Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct; postedited) The poem tells the story of a romantic and eternal love between the narrator and Annabel Lee, who is taken away from him by her kinsman after she dies, but remains with him in his dreams and thoughts." summary5="(Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) In this darkly romantic poem, the narrator reminisces about his beloved Annabel Lee, lamenting her sudden death when she was young, and yearning for her even in her grave off the coast-language and imagery emphasizing their timeless, immortal love.">
