It follows International Quidditch Association rules, with players on brooms and roles such as chasers, beaters, keepers, and seekers. The objective is to score points with a quaffle, bludgers, and catch the snitch to end the game." summary4="(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to play Muggle Quidditch, a non-magical version of the sport from the Harry Potter series, with rules and variations for teams and players." summary5="(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) Muggle Quidditch is a non-magical adaptation of the Harry Potter sport played with various objects and rules, often involving 15 players divided into two teams competing to score goals and capture the snitch.">
