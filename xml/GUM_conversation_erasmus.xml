Erasmus argued that human nature has free will, citing Scripture to support moral responsibility. Luther countered that human will is bound by divine sovereignty and predestination, where God alone grants grace, justifies, and saves—ideas later central to Calvin's teachings." summary4="(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) Luther and Erasmus engage in a debate about the nature of free will, with Luther defending the doctrine of predestination and Erasmus arguing that human beings have a free will to choose between good and evil." summary5="(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) The article discusses the debate between Erasmus and Luther over the issue of free will, with Erasmus arguing that humans have the capacity to choose and respond freely to God's invitation while Luther maintained that salvation is solely determined by God's divine prerogative and predestination.">
