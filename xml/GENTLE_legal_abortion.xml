Wade" type="legal" summary1="(human1) In Roe v. Wade, an appeal before the US Supreme Court (argued 1971, decided 1973) the Court ruled in favor of Roe, a pregnant woman who, with other plaintives, had brought a class action suit against a Texas law proscribing abortion except to save the mother's life, declaring the statute unconstitutional as infringing on the 9th and 14th amendments." summary2="(claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) The 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade ruled that Texas criminal abortion laws violated the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause by infringing on privacy rights, establishing that states cannot ban abortions before fetal viability but can regulate them according to stages of pregnancy and maternal health considerations." summary3="(gpt4o) The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade ruled that Texas criminal abortion laws violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by infringing on a woman's qualified right to terminate her pregnancy, while allowing the state to regulate abortion procedures after the first trimester to protect maternal health and potential human life." summary4="(Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) The United States Supreme Court holds that Texas' abortion law is unconstitutional, allowing states to regulate abortion in the second and third trimesters to protect maternal health and the potentiality of human life, but permitting abortion in the first trimester." summary5="(Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that state criminal abortion laws are unconstitutional, allowing a pregnant woman to seek an abortion without prosecution, based on her right to privacy and the state's interest in maternal health and potential life, up to certain stages of pregnancy.">
