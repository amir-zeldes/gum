Malik, 16 F.3d 45, 48, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 2180, *4-6 (2d Cir. N.Y. February 7, 1994)" type="threat" summary1="(human1) In this letter, the author, who is in prison, pleads for a reversal of their court case while accusing the two White Jewish judges responsible of being racially motivated, and threatening them with armed robbery of $20,000 in cash, as well as intending to submit 5 lawsuits in the Northern District Court in the next two weeks." summary2="(claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) A prisoner threatens to rob two wealthy Jewish Americans of $20,000 upon release and file 5 lawsuits if the court does not reverse its ruling in his case, claiming racial bias and comparing the judges to Pharaoh oppressing the Israelites." summary3="(gpt4o; postedited) In this threatening letter, the imprisoned author, known for robbery, warns that if the court does not provide fair treatment in his case, he plans retaliatory actions against two wealthy American Jews upon his release, drawing parallels to historical oppression and asserting his intent to file multiple lawsuits, thus attempting to intimidate the judicial system." summary4="(Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) The author, a prisoner, threatens to retaliate against two wealthy Jewish Americans by robbing them of $20,000 unless they provide fair treatment in his case, citing a biblical principle of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and asserting that the court has handled his case unfairly." summary5="(Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct; postedited) In a bizarre threat letter, the imprisoned writer warns two white American Jewish judges that he plans to rob them of $20,000 if his case is not dismissed, invoking biblical justice and comparing Jewish judges to historical oppressors.">
