<text id="GUM_court_insanity" partition="test" author="Supreme Court of the United States" dateCollected="2024-09-09" dateCreated="1982-11-02" dateModified="1982-11-02" shortTitle="insanity" sourceURL="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-5195" speakerCount="4" speakerList="#SilasJWasserstrom, #SandraDayOConnor, #WarrenEBurger, #LewisFPowellJr" title="Michael Jones v. United States" type="court" summary1="(human1) In a case before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Michael Jones, attorney Silas J. Wasserstrom argues that an individual found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity cannot legally be held under involuntary commitment for longer than they would have been incarcerated for a guilty verdict." summary2="(claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) A man who attempted to steal a coat in 1975 was found not guilty by reason of insanity and indefinitely committed to a mental hospital, where he has remained for over 7 years - far longer than the 1-year maximum sentence he would have served if convicted - leading to a constitutional challenge of his continued confinement." summary3="(gpt4o) In a Supreme Court case, the petitioner argues for release from indefinite mental hospital commitment, asserting that the government must justify continued confinement beyond the maximum jail sentence he would have received if convicted of attempted petty larceny, raising questions about the relationship between criminal sentencing and civil commitment standards." summary4="(Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) Petitioner, who was acquitted due to insanity, was committed to a mental hospital and argues that he should be released since he has been confined longer than he would have been incarcerated if convicted." summary5="(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) The case involves a petitioner who was committed to a mental hospital indefinitely after being acquitted of a non-violent crime due to insanity, arguing that he should be released as he would have been freed if convicted and the government has not proven his continued commitment necessary beyond the maximum potential prison sentence.">
