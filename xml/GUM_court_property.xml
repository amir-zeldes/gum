Riedell, and Adam M. Walton, plaintiffs, against Richard T. Bissen Jr., County of Maui, Office of the Mayor, Scott Teruya, and County of Maui, Department of Finance, on appeal from the Circuit Court's decision." summary5="(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) In this court case, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs do not have a protected interest in occupying public land and maintaining their property on it, only in the property itself, and thus the circuit court erred in finding jurisdiction over this matter regarding due process.">
