<body>New Zealand begins process to consider changing national flag design Thursday , May 7 , 2015 On Tuesday , the New Zealand government announced the start of a public process to suggest designs for a new national flag , and determine whether their citizens would prefer a different national flag over the current one . The current flag of New Zealand . The current New Zealand flag is partially based on the United Kingdom &apos;s flag ; the new one would be unique to New Zealand . The government &apos;s Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process , with the first meeting set to take place in Christchurch on May 16 . According to the New Zealand Herald , Emeritus Professor John Burrows , the chairman of the project &apos;s panel of twelve , said New Zealand &apos;s flag has never before been open to public choice . Professor Burrows also said resources and kits would be accessible for schools and communities , &quot; For example , schools can run their own flag discussions and referendums to mirror the formal process as part of their own learning exercise &quot; . People were encouraged to submit their designs online at www.flag.govt.nz and suggest what the flag should mean on www.standfor.co.nz . Names of participants would be engraved , at their option , on a flag pole monument to be built in the nation &apos;s capital , Wellington . New Zealand &apos;s Prime Minister John Key said he believes redesigning the flag now has a &quot; strong rationale &quot; . Mr Key promoted the campaign for a unique New Zealand flag on Waitangi Day - February 6 - this year . Of the public process , he said , &quot; In the end I &apos;ll have one vote in each referendum just like every other New Zealander on the electoral roll &quot; . The New Zealand government intends to hold two referendums to reach a verdict on the flag , at an estimated cost of NZ $ 26 million , although a recent poll found only a quarter of citizens favoured changing the flag . This is a decrease from the year before , when it was forty percent . The first referendum is to be held from November 20 to December 11 , selecting a single new flag design out of about four finalists . Voters would then choose between the new flag and their current flag early in 2016 . </body>
