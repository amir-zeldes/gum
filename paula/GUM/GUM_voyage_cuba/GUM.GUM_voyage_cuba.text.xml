<body>Get in For information specific to U.S. citizens see Americans in Cuba Visa and legal issues A tourist visa card ( visa de tarjeta del turista ) is necessary for travelers from most nations . This visa , which is really little more than a piece of paper on which you list your vital statistics , costs between 15 - 25 CUC ( or € 15 - 25 ) , depending on where purchased . It can be purchased at the Airport in Cuba on arrival , however it should be noted that many airlines will require a valid tourist visa card before boarding flights . It is usually valid for 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days at any immigration office in Cuba ( for 25 CUC ) - beyond this you would need a flight out of Cuba within the extended visa period . Canadians are the exception , getting 90 days on arrival and can apply for a 90 day extension . Your passport needs to be valid at least six months past the end of your planned return . Canadian passports must be valid for at least one month beyond the date of expected departure ( [ 2 ] ) . From Canada , the tourist card is normally provided on the flight . It can also be purchased from most Latin American gateway airports if departing from there ( Cancun : 250 MXN , Mexico City : USD 25 ) . Please note that if departing from Europe ( this may apply to other countries ) , you will require to have the visa before boarding the plane . Some times , the airline provides these at the airport , however check first that this is the case . Without a valid visa , boarding will be denied ( the airline would otherwise get a $ 1,000 fine from the Cuban immigration authorities ) . Country-specific advise UK : Applying for the visa is a very simple process and can be done by post or in person at the Cuban embassy in London . When applying to the Cuban Consulate by post , there is a new charge introduced in 2011 which is a £ 25 for a non-personal transaction . If you cannot go to the Cuban Consulate you may consider using VisaCuba ( [ 3 ] ) because it may be cheaper . Through them it may cost £ 20 in total per person . If you apply in person to the Cuban Consulate , you get the visa straight away . It can also be done through online agencies as mentioned before although they may be slightly more expensive ( normally £ 15 + £ 15 admin fee and additional postage ) . Germany : You can obtain the tourist card through the Cuban embassy in post . Travel agencies may often offer cheaper and quicker services though . Regular tourists who renew their 30 day visa are eligible to depart the country ( to any destination ) and return immediately enjoying a further 60 days ( 30 days plus a 30 day extension ) . You are only allowed two consecutive stays in this manner . If you want to stay with friends or family in Cuba you have to go with your intended host within two days after arrival to a migration office and pay 40 CUC for a 30 days family visa . Citizens of Antigua and Barbuda ( 28 days ) , Barbados ( 28 days ) , Benin , Bosnia and Herzegovina , CIS ( except Ukraine and Uzbekistan ) , Dominica , Grenada ( 60 days ) , Liechtenstein ( 90 days ) , Macedonia , Malaysia ( 90 days ) , Mongolia , Montenegro ( 90 days ) , Namibia , Singapore , Slovakia , Saint Kitts and Nevis , Saint Lucia , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Serbia ( 90 days ) , Turkmenistan who can stay 30 days without visa . ( The source of the previous sentence is unknown . Aeromexico staff at Cancun airport claim that only citizens of China and Russia need no visa . It is important to note that there is also a departure tax of CUC 25 , to be paid in cash when departing Cuba by airplane ; this is not required for boat departures . This tax is not well publicized but it is essential to remember it . You will run into significant difficulties if you do not have enough cash to pay this tax when leaving the country . An ATM and currency exchange are available at Havana airport , but these facilities are not as reliable in Cuba as in other places . Cuban customs can be strict , though they sometimes go easy on tourists . </body>
