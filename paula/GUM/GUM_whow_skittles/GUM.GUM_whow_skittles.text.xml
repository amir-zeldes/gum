<body>How to Make Skittles Vodka Three Methods : Single Serving ( 25 mL Shot ) Bottles of &quot; Skittled &quot; Vodka Dishwasher Bottle Method Making Skittles vodka is a fun way to add a splash of fruity flavor and color to regular vodka . All you need to do is place your favorite combination of Skittles candies into a glass or bottle of vodka and wait for it to infuse . You can then use your Skittles vodka to make brightly-colored cocktails or even serve it as a sugary shot ! Find multiple methods for making Skittles vodka after the jump -- and soon you &apos;ll be tasting the rainbow ! Ingredient A handle ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) of vodka per bag of Skittles A large bag of Skittles candy ( the &quot; movie size &quot; bag ) Method 1 of 3 : Single Serving ( 25 mL Shot ) Separate the colors of Skittles that you want to flavor the vodka with . Many people choose to leave out the green , which is lime if you &apos;re using original Skittles , and purple , which is grape in the original style , as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product . However , you can put them in if you want . If you do n&apos;t mind mixed flavors , you can just skip this step altogether . Add six Skittles to 25 ml of vodka . Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved . Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe . You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles . Filter out the remaining Skittle &quot; insides &quot; . With single servings like this , you can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles , if you desire . Method 2 of 3 : Bottles of &quot; Skittled &quot; Vodka Pour out some vodka from a bottle to make room for Skittles . Separate the Skittles by color . Add the Skittles ( 20 - 25 per 350 ml / 11.8 fl oz ) . Let the mixture sit for a day or two . Shake occasionally so the flavour mixes well . Strain out the Skittles using a filter , such as a paper coffee filter or a clean t-shirt . Refrigerate overnight . Method 3 of 3 : Dishwasher Bottle Method Separate the colors from five bags of 200 g Skittles . Using 5 x 700 ml / 23.6 fl oz bottles , pour 300 ml / 10.1 fl oz of vodka into a jug and fill each bottle with skittles . Place the bottles in your dishwasher and put on an intensive cycle . One third of of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously . Two thirds of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously . Once the cycle has finished , shake all bottles vigorously again . Then place in the freezer for 2 hours . Once the vodka is cold , it should be syrupy . Take a sieve , line it with a piece of cheesecloth ( muslin ) or a coffee filter , place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly . Once the first bottle has been filtered , wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in . Repeat the above two steps for all bottles , ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination . Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink . Do n&apos;t worry , the vodka wo n&apos;t freeze . You are finished . Enjoy your tasty creation . Tips . If you want to make it more quickly , cut the skittles in half before putting them into vodka . Shake every 15 minutes . They &apos;ll dissolve in an hour instead of a day . Or you could just scoop them out when the color dissolves . Start with small amount of vodka and Skittles at first to experiment which combination of taste suits you best . You can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste . The lime green Skittles add a sourness to the drink , so if you want one that &apos;s sweet , leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka . Another approach is to buy five bottles of vodka and five bags of Skittles . Then separate the candy and use one flavor for each bottle . ( Or get four bottles and an empty , to allow room for the skittles . ) If using a t-shirt to strain , be sure fabric softener or a dryer sheet had not been used with it , lets you get some extra ( unwanted ) flavoring ( and potentially toxic chemicals ) . Warnings Drink responsibly . Never drink and drive . Know your limits , and do not drink to the extent of intoxication . Do not drink if underage in your country . Things You &apos;ll Need Each handle of vodka ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) requires a large bag worth of Skittles , so if you plan on doing only one flavor for a flavorful vodka , you &apos;ll have to buy 5 large bags of Skittles . Coffee filter , cheesecloth / muslin , or an extremely clean T-shirt Large funnel or strainer to hold filter </body>
