<body>Microsoft waits for death of Internet Explorer 6 Tuesday , March 8 , 2011 With development of Microsoft &apos;s Internet Explorer 9 ( IE9 ) browser almost complete , Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for IE6 users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser . Microsoft has replaced it with three newer versions . On a new website , &quot; The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown &quot; , Microsoft has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE . Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent . &quot; [ Ten ] years ago , a browser was born . Its name was Internet Explorer 6 . Now that we ’re in 2011 , in an era of modern web standards , it ’s time to say goodbye , &quot; Microsoft says on &quot; The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown &quot; . Internet Explorer &apos;s market share is slipping . IE &apos;s various versions accounted for 70 percent of the market in 2009 ; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today . Mozilla Firefox , its main rival , has been actively increasing its market share while the recently released Google Chrome is also quickly gaining users . PC World &apos;s recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded , &quot; Usually , Internet Explorer is the # 2 browser after Firefox , but over the past 30 days it s been # 3 , a couple of points behind Safari - and nearly tied with Chrome . It might be a statistical blip . But if it is n&apos;t , and Chrome continues to surge , IE could fall to fourth place . &quot; Web developers face big problems with IE6 . As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with advanced web technology and geared to the newest web core markup language HTML 5 , they are forced to accommodate older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users . Also , not mentioned on Microsoft &apos;s &quot; The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown &quot; site , are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser at risk of being hacked . The Internet security firm Secunia.com , has said that as of March 4 , 2011 , IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities ; 39 percent of these are rated &quot; highly critical &quot; . Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats . Microsoft &apos;s Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it . IE6 shipped with Windows XP , nearly a decade ago . But it has outlived its usefulness , and Microsoft no longer wants to support it . </body>
