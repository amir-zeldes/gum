Today ’s generation will not survive a day without the help of lighting . In fact , someone ’s productivity , particularly at night , depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity . Lighting takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines . There are different type of lighting bulbs used at home can affect the overall lighting consumption . Nowadays , most commonly and widely used bulb in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light ( CFL ) . However , the main problem of CFL is the mercury they contain . In addition to this is the harmful effect of mercury such as Emission of UV Radiation . In response to the said problem , this project study gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment , health and safety as well energy conservation , by developing a segmented compact light-emitting diode ( SCLED ) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient , economical , and does not contain toxic chemicals . 1. Introduction Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey ( HECS ) , electricity remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines . About 87 percent of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011 . As of 2016 , the demand for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors . It is often grouped depending on its uses that are distributed for heating and cooling , lighting , operating appliances etc [ 1 ] Figure 1 . January - june 2016 philippine power demand Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical homes as shown in figure 1 , consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption . Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy ; it consumes about 18 % of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [ 2 ] . Figure 2 . Estimated electricity use in residential sector One of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb . The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage . There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays : the ( light-emitting diode ) LED bulb , ( compact fluorescent light ) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb . But each of them has their perks and perils [ 3 ] . Unfortunately , most of the time , people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary . Today , CFLs are the most used lighting sources in the household . Using CFLs will allow people to decrease their energy consumption ; also it is a good start to decrease greenhouse emissions . However , the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain . When products and wastes containing mercury are improperly disposed of , mercury is released into the air , ground or water . It is persistent in the environment ; it never breaks down nor goes away . In addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits Ultraviolet ( UV ) Radiation . This UV radiation interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light . The acute and chronic effects are the normal responses of the skin to UVR ; acute reactions considered will be erythema ( sunburn ) and vitamin D production . Skin aging and skin cancer will be discussed as those reactions produced by prolonged or repeated UVR exposure [ 4 ] . In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources , the proponents conducted this study . Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials , the proponents conducted a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb .</body>
