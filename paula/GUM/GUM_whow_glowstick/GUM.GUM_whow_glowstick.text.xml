<body>How to Make a Glowstick Those glowing Mountain Dew videos with peroxide and baking soda are all hoaxes . To truly make a glowstick without breaking an already-made glowstick and shoving its contents into a tube ( also known as cheating ) , you &apos;ve gotta let your inner scientist out ( along with a few dollars ) . If you &apos;re still curious , read on . This is fun for anyone and everyone . Method One of Two : Using Luminol Put on protective glasses . In addition , wear gloves to protect your skin . It &apos;s also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best . Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected . Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children ! Listen up , kids : You &apos;ll be working with a solution that &apos;s near a 12 on the pH scale . That basically means do n&apos;t swallow it , do n&apos;t put it in your eyes , do n&apos;t bathe in it , and do n&apos;t really expose yourself to it directly at all . Got it ? Moving on . Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl . A ceramic bowl will work best , but plastic works too . Use funnels , measuring tubes , and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you . Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol &apos;s nitrogen atoms with oxygen . When that happens , all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results ? The glow . Mix .2 grams of luminol , 4 grams of sodium carbonate , .4 grams of copper sulfate , .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter ( 0.3 US gal ) of distilled water in a second bowl . It is important not to touch the luminol . Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy . Unfortunately , these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests . Yep , unless you &apos;re a coroner or some sort of crazy spy / criminologist you probably do n&apos;t have this stuff lying around the house ( hopefully not ... ) . If you &apos;re dead set on starting your own glowstick business ( worse ideas exist ) , try websites like Alfa Aesar [ 1 ] or Sigma Aldrich [ 2 ] for supplies . Mix everything well . Do n&apos;t use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort . Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly . It &apos;s important to use sanitary , clean tubes for your glowsticks . The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you &apos;re depending on to make the substances glow . Set the correct lid next to each container . This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling . It &apos;s not like the glow will get up and run away from you , but still . Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles . Shake them up once the lids are on tightly . Then turn off the lights ! If it &apos;s not already glowing , something went wrong . Do over ! Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow . Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them ! But act quickly ... the glow wo n&apos;t last very long . Expectations crushed ? Method two to the rescue ! The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates does n&apos;t last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes . For something that lasts hours , go to the next method ( which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory , but it &apos;s still worth mentioning ) . </body>
