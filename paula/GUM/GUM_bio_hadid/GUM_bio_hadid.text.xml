She was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize , in 2004 . She received the UK 's most prestigious architectural award , the Stirling Prize , in 2010 and 2011 . In 2012 , she was made a Dame by Elizabeth II for services to architecture , and in 2015 she became the first and only woman to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects . She was described by The Guardian of London as the ' Queen of the curve ' , who " liberated architectural geometry , giving it a whole new expressive identity . " Her major works include the aquatic centre for the London 2012 Olympics , Michigan State University 's Broad Art Museum in the US , and the Guangzhou Opera House in China . Some of her designs have been presented posthumously , including the statuette for the 2017 Brit Awards , and many of her buildings are still under construction , including the Al Wakrah Stadium in Qatar , a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup . Early life and academic career Hadid was born on 31 October 1950 in Baghdad , Iraq , to an upper-class Iraqi family . Her father Mohammed Hadid Muhammad al-Hajj Husayn Hadid was a wealthy industrialist from Mosul . He co-founded the left-liberal al-Ahali group in 1932 , a significant political organisation in the 1930s and 1940s . He was the co-founder of the National Democratic Party in Iraq . He served as minister of finance after the overthrow of the monarch after the 1958 Iraqi coup d'état for the government of General Abd al-Karim Qasim . Her mother Wajiha al-Sabunji was an artist from Mosul . In the 1960s Hadid attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland . Hadid studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut before moving , in 1972 , to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture . There she studied with Rem Koolhaas , Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi . Her former professor , Koolhaas , described her at graduation as " a planet in her own orbit . " Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught . " We called her the inventor of the 89 degrees . Nothing was ever at 90 degrees . She had spectacular vision . All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces . " He recalled that she was less interested in details , such as staircases . " The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling , and the space was reducing and reducing , and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling . She could n’t care about tiny details . Her mind was on the broader pictures — when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later . She was right . ’ Her fourth-year student project was a painting of a hotel in the form of a bridge , inspired by the works of the Russian suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich</body>
