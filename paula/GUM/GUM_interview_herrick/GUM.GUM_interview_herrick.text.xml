<body>Jack Herrick , wikiHow founder interviewed by Wikinews Saturday , January 31 , 2009 Herrick at RecentChangesCamp 2008 Image : ShakataGaNai . wikiHow is a wiki-based site which aims to &quot; build the world &apos;s largest , highest quality how-to manual . &quot; It recently published its 50,000th article , and to discuss what the site has achieved since its creation , Wikinews interviewed the site &apos;s founder , Jack Herrick . In the interview , Herrick explains what wikiHow is , why he decided to create it , how he grew it in size , and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license ( HyperLink ) for his site . Read below for more of the interview in full . Interview For our readers who are unaware of your site , could you briefly explain what wikiHow is ? Sure . wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world &apos;s largest , highest quality how-to manual . Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language . We &apos;re quite far from our goals currently , but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles . We hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status . That said , we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve . However , in terms of readership , we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia . We get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast . [ Note : The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met ] Like Wikipedia , wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software . Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world . That said , we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects : We are much smaller . The English wikiHow has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia . As a result , wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors . We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good . This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation . We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations . Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons . ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity ) . In addition , we &apos;ve used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral . ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral ) Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility . As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online . Why did you decide to create wikiHow ? I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person . Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine . How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity ? I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world . Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful . I &apos;ve been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow . My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow . eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world . eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software . When I ran eHow , the content was professionally produced and edited . This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets . However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices . You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n&apos;t produce the topics that wo n&apos;t interest advertisers , or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n&apos;t cost much to write . I was n&apos;t interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world &apos;s how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive . So ultimately I decided that eHow &apos;s model would not build the resource I envisioned . When I discovered Wikipedia , I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs . So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow . Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license ? We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) . In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the &quot; right to leave . &quot; If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere . This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license . This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community . I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far . My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others . That said , when we started out I did n&apos;t know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver &apos;s license . As a result , we made some mistakes along the path . In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC . At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects . wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month . How did you grow the site to the size it is today ? In December 2008 , wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics ( Full data : http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics ) . Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US . ( http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com ) . wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons . First , people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information . People want to learn more practical skills , and for the most part the internet does n&apos;t provide enough quality information yet . Second , we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing : We had some articles of mixed quality , and editors joined to improve those articles , which in turn attracted more readers . We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle : More readers , means more editors , which creates better instructions , leading again to more readers . It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed . </body>
