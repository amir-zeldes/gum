The attack was launched on Wednesday by a user labelled " Anonymous " , on the website " Insurgency Wiki " , a spinoff of 4chan . The " History " section of the site explains , in a satirical fashion , that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology 's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube . Though YouTube is complying with the Church of Scientology 's requests to take down the video , other sites such as Gawker.com have stated that they will keep hosting the video . " So far , it 's the Internet : 1 , Scientology : 0 . But it 's a long game . " - Matthew Ingram Writing in a blog post , Matthew Ingram of The Globe and Mail dubbed the ongoing conflict involving the Church of Scientology 's attempts to remove the Cruise video from the Internet : " Scientology vs. the Internet , part XVII " . He characterized the conflict between the Church of Scientology and anonymous posters of the Cruise video as " another small skirmish in a war that Scientology has been waging for almost 15 years , since the early days of newsgroups such as alt.religion.scientology , which posted internal church documents in 1994 . Lawsuits have been filed , mailing lists have been shut down , homes of discussion group participants have been raided and their computers seized -- an all-out war . " " Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video , a new obsession is taking hold on the internet . An insurgency against The Church of Scientology . " Anonymous blogger , " Anon declares war on Church of Scientology " One poster admitted to being a part of the effort , writing in a blog post " I have myself , as per instructions , loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage . There s [ sic ] something in the hilarious anarchy of the net that produces these ' events ' every now and again . " The poster wrote that " Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video , a new obsession is taking hold on the internet . An insurgency against The Church of Scientology . " " Someone emailed me earlier today talking about a tool a group ’s been using to attack the scientology website . It ’s an interesting tool , created to overload/create malformed strings and crash a website ’s database , " said the post by an unknown author on pigmy . The Church 's website is currently unreachable . Some individuals reported that when they are able to reach the site , all they get is a message stating , " The word scientology means search for truth ... " . As of 15:11 GMT the site was accessible again , but only loads at relatively slow speeds , and by the end of the day Saturday the site was not loading at all . Posts on the message board for the Scientology-critic site Operation Clambake from Friday theorized that a denial-of-service attack had occurred , and wrote that as of Friday the Scientology.org site was either not loading at all , or loading very slowly . Critics of Scientology at the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology were critical of the attacks to the Church of Scientology website , with one poster writing " How can people look at both sides if one side is gone ? " Traffic to the Scientology website had already increased 18-fold prior to the attack , following increased attention after the Tom Cruise video appeared on the Internet . At that time , one in three visits to the site came from BBC News , and the website increased to number 3 in the company Hitwise UK 's Lifestyle-Religion category .</body>
