Currently Shalev is a Professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem 's Einstein Institute of Mathematics . At the moment Shalev is in Levico Terme , Trento , Italy for a conference . He was interviewed by Wikinews . Interview Aner Shalev What are you going to talk about here in Levico ? I called it Character , walks and words . There is a whole topic which is called asymptotic groups theory . There are groups which express the symmetry of some structures . Studying groups is a bit like studying symmetry . It 's very beautiful I think . And then when you do it in an asymptotic way is like you do n't look at the small details . It 's like from the sky . You look at the general patterns . And there is another topic which is very important in mathematics which is called representation theory . So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory to solve all kind of problems and conjectures in asymptotic groups theory . Why did you choose to study mathematics ? First of all because it was beautiful . When I was ten my father already showed me some stuff in mathematics and the beauty and the imagination was quite apparent . I also like the freedom in mathematics . If you study physics or chemistry then you should describe the real world . But in mathematics you can build your own structures . You can walk in worlds created by the imagination of people . You 're not committed to the real world . It 's almost like God to some extent . You can create worlds , you can study them . I think it 's a combination of the beauty , of the imagination , of the freedom . Many people , and many students , dislike math . Why do you think it is so ? First of all I think maybe they have bad teachers , which is a problem . You have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it . Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it – you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom , and the imagination , and creation . Maybe they do n't like the precise nature of mathematics . Also when I talk mathematics I notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they do n't know how to write a composition . They have ideas but they can not formulate them in the right way . Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world , but you can also create worlds of fiction . So you have imagination , you have total freedom , you can invent characters , you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another . Also the language is important in writing and in literature . So in a way people often do n't know how to combine the two fields . It could look like almost the opposite : literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers . For example the most famous is Lewis Carrol , author of Alice in Wonderland . You 're not only a mathematician . You also wrote two collections of short stories and a novel . Why did you begin to write ? When I was quite young I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams . I was trying to interpret my dreams . I started to write down my dreams . And then I noticed that I cheat a little bit when I write them down . Sometimes I make them more pretty then they were actually . So instead of documenting the dreams it gradually became also like adding creational elements , and I think that somehow through writing my dreams I gradually came to writing , also poems , but mainly stories . I 'm a little bit inspired by dreams but when eventually I started to write more seriously I was more interested in structure which also .. a bit like mathematics in a way .. for example my first book is called Opus 1 .. a collection of four long stories with musical structures . The first part is called Legato and the second part was called Staccato . In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness . In the staccato part it 's like a music : a lot of break , very very short sentences . It was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people . In the second book I made another experiment . It 's a book of opening , Overtures I called it , and there is no end to the stories . There are seventy beginning of stories without ends . In the novel Dark Matters I think what interested me in the structure was two thing : simple narrative and email . It keeps changing between narrative and email . Another thing was two different time scapes : one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end . It 's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle . ... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot . Why did you choose this particular structure ? When I tell stories I do n't like that everything will be clear from the beginning . I like that something will be a bit of secret , or even unreliable narrator : someone tells something and first you trust him but then you read more and you become thrilled by everything . I think by using emails on the one hand which are more the voice of the woman Eva and narrative which is more the perspective of the man Adam , I kind of confront them , their different perspective and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way the story is told . I think that in this kind of structure there is a very gradual clarification of the relationship and the forth going on .</body>
