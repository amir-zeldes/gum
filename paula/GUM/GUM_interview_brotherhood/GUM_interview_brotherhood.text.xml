Wikinews spoke with William Evans , president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians , about the current state of magic and what its future looks like in the world of entertainment . For how long have you been involved in performing / studying magic ? Over 50 years . I am 61 now so I really started when I was about 10 years old even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier . I remember going into Hollywood Magic and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it and I did n't even know what it did . The magician behind the counter was wise enough not to sell it to me , but instead sold me two books which I still own today - " Scarne on Card Tricks " and " Scarne on Magic Tricks " . That started me out on books and I have amassed quite a few since then . My major influences on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner . October is National Magic Month in the US . Do you think magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment today ? Absolutely . There are more magicians working today than ever before . There will always be an audience for good magicians doing good magic . Has the internet helped or hurt magic ? Both . I think it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby , but I think it has hurt the ability of young magicians to think because so many rely on the internet for everything and they are n't reading the books . We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before . Moreover , seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses , originality and imagination that reading and thinking about magic can produce . Anyone can become a monkey ; it takes serious study to become a magician . Do you travel much in your current role ? Yes , I am traveling quite a bit . After I was inducted as International President in Phoenix in July , I have been to the Jeff McBride Experience in Eureka Springs , Arkansas , Magic Live in Las Vegas , The Midwest Magic Jubilee in St. Louis , the TAOM in Dallas , the British Ring Convention in Buxton , England and the Magic Circle in London . I am going to Las Vegas and Los Angeles next month , Italy in November , back to Las Vegas in December , Mexico in January , Magi-Fest in February , the Winter Carnival of Magic in Tennessee in March , Eureka Springs Cavalcade of Magic in March , and the FFFF in April . That 's as of now . File photo of magician David Gish displaying magic props for a young child . Image : Paul Budd .</body>
