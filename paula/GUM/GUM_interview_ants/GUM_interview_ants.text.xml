Nick Bos , of the University of Helsinki , studies " the amazing adaptations social insects have evolved in order to fight the extreme parasite pressure they experience " . In a recently-accepted Evolution paper Bos and colleagues describe ants appearing to self-medicate . " I have no doubt that as time goes on , there will be more and more cases documented " The team used Formica fusca , an ant species that can form thousand-strong colonies . This common black ant eats other insects , and also aphid honeydew . It often nests in tree stumps or under rocks and foraging workers can sometimes be spotted climbing trees . Some ants were infected with Beauveria bassiana , a fungus . Infected ants chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide , whereas healthy ants avoided it . Hydrogen peroxide reduced infected ant fatalities by 15 % , and the ants varied their intake depending upon how high the peroxide concentration was . In the wild , Formica fusca can encounter similar chemicals in aphids and dead ants . The Independent reported self-medicating ants a first among insects . Bos obtained his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen . He began postdoctoral research at Helsinki in 2012 . He also runs the AntyScience blog . The blog aims to help address " a gap between scientists and ' the general public ' . " The name is a pun referencing ants , its primary topic , science , and " non-scientific " jargon-free communication . He now discusses his work with Wikinews .

Me and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies , from beetles , to butterflies and mantids , to ants . We had the ants in an observation nest , and I could just look at them for hours , watching them go about . This was in my third year of Biology study I think . After a while I needed to start thinking about an internship for my M.Sc. studies , and decided to write a couple of professors . I ended up going to the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen where I did a project on learning in Ants under supervision of Prof. Patrizia d'Ettorre . I liked it so much there I ended up doing a PhD and I 've been working on social insects ever since . What methods and equipment were used for this investigation ? This is a fun one . I try to work on a very low budget , and like to build most of the experimental setups myself ( we actually have equipment in the lab nicknamed the ' Nickinator ' , ' i-Nick ' and the ' Nicktendo64 ' ) . There 's not that much money in fundamental science at the moment , so I try to cut the costs wherever possible . We collected wild colonies of Formica fusca by searching through old tree-trunks in old logging sites in southern Finland . We then housed the ants in nests I made using Y-tong [ aerated concrete ] . It 's very soft stone that you can easily carve . We carved out little squares for the ants to live in ( covered with old CD covers to prevent them escaping ! ) . We then drilled a tunnel to a pot ( the foraging arena ) , where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine and the food without . We infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana . Afterwards , each ant was dipped in the solution for a couple of seconds , dried on a cloth and put in the nest . After exposing the ants to the fungus , we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day , and counted how many ants were present on each food-source . Example of aerated concrete , which provided a home for the subjects . Image : Marco Bernardini . This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected . The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [ Reactive Oxygen Species , the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide ] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way ( as you have to ' force feed ' the ROS , as healthy ants , when given the choice , ignore that food-source . ) For this we basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while . And afterwards either infected them or not . Then for about two weeks we count every day how many ants died . This gives us the data to do a so-called survival analysis . We measured the ROS-concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a spectrophotometer . By adding certain chemicals , the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length . The detrimental effect of ROS on spores was easy to measure . We mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores , plated them out on petridishes with an agar-solution where fungus can grow on . A day after , we counted how many spores were still alive . How reliable do you consider your results to be ? The results we got are very reliable . We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants , and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind . This means the experimenter does n't know which ants belong to which treatment , so it 's impossible to influence the results with ' observer bias ' . However , of course this is proof in just one species . It is hard to extrapolate to other ants , as different species lead very different lives .</body>
