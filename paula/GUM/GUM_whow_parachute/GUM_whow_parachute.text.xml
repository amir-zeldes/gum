	</header><body>How to Cope With a Double Parachute Failure While skydiving , it is possible ( yet extremely unlikely ) that both your primary and reserve parachutes will malfunction , leaving you with no method of reducing your velocity . In the vast majority of cases , this will not occur ; nevertheless , in this event these coping strategies may assist . Steps Remain calm . This may seem obvious , but deep , even breathing ( despite the rushing slipstream ) and controlling your heart-rate are essential to your continued survival . Entreat assistance . If both your primary and reserve chutes have malfunctioned , signal immediately to a fellow jumper who has not yet deployed their chute , waving your arms and signalling that your own is not functional . If this is a solo jump , then skip to step 6 . Prepare for deployment . After linking arms with your fellow jumper , you will need to hook your arms through their chest strap , or through both sides of the front of their harness , as far as you can , then grab onto your own strap . Deploy . The shock of the chute deployment will be intense . The G-forces will multiply your body weight , making it impossible to hold on ; this is why hooking your arms through the harness is essential . It is likely that the shock will dislocate or break both your arms ; nevertheless this is a small price to pay for your life . Prepare for impact . If your companion 's canopy has successfully opened , then both your chances of survival have dramatically increased . With a large and slow canopy , your chances are even better . The canopy must be steered away from power lines and similar obstructions ; try for a large body of water if you are confident your companion can save you from drowning . Alternative : Lack of companions If this is a solo jump , which constitutes the minority of skydivers , your only recourse is to ensure that at least one of your own chutes opens . In this case , the excellent advice offered by your instructors on assisting chute opening may be of assistance to you . If it becomes apparent that you cannot open either of your two parachutes , or that for some other reason they are fatally non-functional , then the following steps may be of some minor assistance . Appeal . If you are of a religious turn of mind , you may wish at this point to offer a prayer to a god , goddess , protective spirit or guardian angel . St Jude , the patron saint of Lost Causes , comes to mind . Objectively , this is not likely to help very much ; but it may improve your emotional state . If you do not have any religious beliefs , or are for another reason unwilling to appeal to your patron deity , skip this step . Contemplate . As you approach the Earth at , or close to , terminal velocity , you may wish to contemplate your past existence , and the possibility of a future afterlife . A strategy that might prove helpful is to consider how fortunate you are that life has been good to you so far . Alternatively , if life has not been good to you so far , ( and considering your current situation this seems more likely ) consider how lucky you are that it will not be troubling you much longer . Expect impact . You are unlikely to have the time or ability to aim for a soft landing-spot , body of water , or other impact site that might improve your chances of survival . There is a minuscule chance that your impact will result in non-life-threatening injuries ; if this seems incredibly far-fetched , comfort yourself that double chute failure in modern times is also extremely unlikely , and that you have already beaten worse odds . Tips Your reserve chute should have been packed by a certified rigger and is moderately less likely to fail ; therefore , it may be helpful to focus your efforts on opening your reserve parachute . Some humans who have , for various reasons , become aware of their impending death , develop psychological coping strategies to deal with this ; for instance , the Kubler-Ross phases of grief . Since your own death approaches far more quickly , this is unlikely to be of any use to you . Warnings Water landings : if you have successfully attached to a companion whose chute opens , keep in mind that both your arms may be broken or dislocated , and you may be unable to swim or tread water before your chute fills and drags you under . If , after total chute failure , you land on something soft , it is possible that instead of being killed outright , you may be permanently paralyzed due to spinal injury . If you have a strong aversion to this outcome , aiming head-downward before impact in the manner of an Olympic diver may ensure the destruction of your cranium and your immediate demise .</body>
