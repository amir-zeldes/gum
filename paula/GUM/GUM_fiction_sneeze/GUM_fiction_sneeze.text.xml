	</header><body>Does n’t it make you just want to sneeze ? Pete was leaning against the wall , watching the street go by . I pulled the bike to a halt , the front wheel pointing in his direction . “ I think I ’ve got a fairy stuck up my nose . ” “ S’ not true ! ” came a voice from inside the nose in question . “ Hey ! Not bad that ! ” Pete said . “ I did n’t see your lips move at all . ” “ It ’s not a joke . ” The itching was getting worse . I pulled out a paper tissue . “ Stop that now ! ” came the voice again . “ You know I do n’t like it . ” “ S’ not my fault . You make me want to sneeze ! ” And I did . I inspected the crumpled paper . Lots of yellow goo , but no fairy . Pete looked at me with mild disgust as I eyed the handkerchief more closely . “ You know that ’s pretty gross … ” he said . “ Got any other brilliant remarks ? ” I said . I held a finger up to my lips , and waved a hand to silence Pete ’s reply . “ Are you still there ? ” I called . “ No thanks to you ! ” came the little voice . Pete looked at me sort of sideways . “ Look , the first time was OK , but — ” “ It ’s not a joke . I ’ve really got something stuck up there . I was riding on me bike and I thought I ’d swallowed an insect or something . And then it started insulting me . ” “ You ’re having me on , right ? ” “ Pete ! Look at me . If it ’s a trick , how do I do it then ? ” Pete thought for a moment . “ If it ’s real … Are n’t they supposed to have a pot of gold or something ? And they have to tell you where it is if you catch them ? ” “ That ’s leprechauns , idiot ! ” said the voice from my noise . “ So what ’s the difference ? Just give us the gold and we ’ll let you go … ” “ We — ? ” I started . He winked at me . “ Oh , I ’m happy to stick around , ” came the voice . “ It ’s noggins here who wants to get rid of me … ” Suddenly I felt a violent pain in my nose , my eyes watered . “ Owwww ! ” I howled . “ See what I mean ? ” the voice shouted over my moans . “ Perhaps you can use it in exams … ” Pete said , scratching his head . “ You know , it could tell us all the answers . ” “ Idiot ! If it yacks on like that in an exam , I ’ll get thrown out . And probably locked up too . ” “ Ca n’t it whisper ? ” “ Perhaps I do n’t know the answers anyway ? ” said the voice . “ Have you thought of that ? ” “ Anyway , I do n’t want it in exams . I just want it to go . Out of my nose . ” “ Ca n’t you just poke it out ? ” “ With what ? ” “ S’pose you ’ve already tried your finger … ” “ Yes he has , ” the voice said . “ And it was n’t pleasant I can tell you . ” “ You see what it ’s like . He ’s already making sarcastic remarks like that … ” “ What if we put something in your nose to catch it , then ? I do n’t know … A spider ? ” “ No ! ” we both said at once . “ Snap ! ” Pete said . “ You both said the same thing at the same time , you ’ve got to make a — ” He hit his forehead with his palm . “ That ’s it ! Three wishes ! When you catch a fairy , you get three wishes . Hey you in there ! Is that right ? ” “ You could see things like that … ” said the voice with resignation . “ I wish you ’d get out of my nose , then ! ” I cried . In a flash the fairy was out of my nose and gone . And I ’m still waiting for my two other wishes . THE END Something a little lighter this week , I hope you enjoy it . Once it got started , I realised that the idea must have been inspired by the title of Justine Larbalestier ’s How to Ditch Your Fairy , although it has nothing at all to do with that story at all . All in all , my story feels very light . But I think I needed something a little less dark , and there are some quite sombre tales coming up in the coming weeks . See you then .</body>
