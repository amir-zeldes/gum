Those who 've never heard of this will be amazed to see a chicken lie perfectly still after these instructions are followed . Biologists think that fear causes this " hypnosis , " which may be an attempt to " play dead " to fool predators . Method One of Two : Hypnotizing a Chicken Hold the chicken down on a flat surface . Hold the chicken with one hand supporting the breast . Place it down so that its breast is carrying its weight and rests on the ground . Continue to hold its feet so the grand experiment can continue . You can place the chicken on its breast instead . Press gently down on its back , and gently move its legs back if it tries to stand up . Wiggle your finger . Hold the bird down gently with one hand . Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip , without touching it . Move the finger backward to about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) away , then back again . Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking . Let go of its legs . The chicken should be " hypnotized " and cease to struggle . It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes . Draw a line in front of its beak instead . If the chicken was n't hypnotized , try this alternative . Using chalk , a stick , or your finger , draw a line on the ground 12 " ( 30 cm ) long . Start near the chicken 's beak and draw the line slowly outward , in front of its head . Wake it up by clapping . Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business . Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away . Method Two of Two : Reducing Stress in the Chicken Understand the hypnotic effect . Researchers call this effect " tonic immobility " . " When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened , its heart rate lowers and it stops moving . This may be an attempt to play dead , discouraging predators that prefer live prey . Unlike an opossum , the chicken gives an unconvincing act , as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way . " Keep the chicken upright or on its side . While it 's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet , this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken 's hip . Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may " succeed " by cutting off its air supply . This can cause the chicken significant discomfort , leading to fainting or even , rarely , death . Keep hypnosis short and infrequent . It 's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes . Even if it does , the chicken should n't suffer as long as you let it go soon afterward . Hours of stress , or regular exposure to stressful situations , can cause serious health problems . Get your chickens used to humans and novelty . Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect . Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help . Hens raise in battery cages stay " hypnotized " longer , possibly because of greater fear . Watch for signs of stress . Abnormal feathering , constant preening , or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken . While hypnotizing is unlikely to cause serious harm , any type of stress is more damaging to a chicken in this state .</body>
