	</header><body>Falling You ’re on the 236th-level Kaiserstrasse moving sidewalk when you see her . You ’re leaning on the railing , waiting to ask Derya about a job , watching the glittering stream of mites that arc over half the sky — flying up to rewind their nanosprings in the stratospheric sunlight , flying down to make Frankfurt run . You never get tired of watching them . She ’s on the Holbeinsteg bridge . Someone ’s hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth-century modernism , plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up , between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars . She ’s wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad-brimmed hat , and it ’s like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge , the bright blobs of subway graffiti , and her yellow dress , flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge ’s rail . A picture of elegance and style from the age of money , violence , and simplicity . She ’s a strawberry blonde , slim , her skin blank and virginal as new butter . She ’s beyond the rail now , hanging out over the mountain - high drop . Thin translucent shadows move across her — the shadows of the neosilk-and-nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five-kilometer-high towers that encircle it . ( A civic agent notices you noticing , and attaches itself to your infospace , whispering statistics — “ Each object ’s suspension must weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80 % of the towers ” — “ Frankfurt ’s current population is stable at 53 million ” — “ Average age 62 , birth rate 0.22 , net immigration of half a million a year ” — “ Current personal squatright : 311 cubic meters per resident ” — until you brush it away . ) You ’re watching her lean out . The wind whips her hair , ruffles the skirt around her knees . She must be a tourist . You remember your first trip to the upper levels : leaning over the edge into the angry swarm of mites , whirring and buzzing warnings and shoving you back like a million mosquito chaperones . Everyone tries it once — Except that there are n’t any mites around her . You clutch the railing . Hot , animal fear surges in your chest . She looks up at you and , across the gap of forty meters , smiles a brilliant , heartbreaking smile . Then she lets go and falls . You scream . “ Fucking airsurfers , ” says Derya . He steps off the moving sidewalk near you : tall , hook-nosed , the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest ; the glowing , formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps . You swallow on a dry throat . Derya , of all people , hearing you scream ! He gives you a hooded look . “ They infect themselves with some designer virus - it lets them hack the city ’s person-recognition systems . So the mites do n’t see them when they jump . Watch — ” She ’s swept past the whalelike oval of the public pool on the 202nd , past the sloping mandala of the Google of offices on the 164th . At the 131st , below her , is the old Stock Exchange , hung upside-down now as a hipster den . Now the mites are finally closing in . A silver swarm coalesces around the 164th , and she vanishes into it , like a snip of scallion into cloudy miso soup . When the cloud disperses , she ’s standing on one of the Stock Exchange ’s upside-down overhangs . She waves , antlike , then crawls through a dormer window . “ It ’s not funny , ” Derya says . “ They ’re a huge drain on emergency preparedness . Ripple effects are causing project slowdowns ... ” “ Freeloaders drive systemic evolution , ” you find yourself saying . “ Do n’t you quote the founders at me , ” Derya snaps . “ The Free Society is fragile . The minute enough people find anticontributive behavior cool , the party ’s over — it ’s back to capitalist competition or state control . ” He stares until you meet his eye . “ You even talk to those people - are you paying attention ? — you even talk to them , your rep will be trashed on all the major servers . You wo n’t work , you wo n’t party , you ’ll be defriended by every one of your tribes . Got it ? ” Her broad-brimmed hat is still sailing on the wind . The mites missed it . It cuts between the towers of the 50th . The upside-down trading floor is deserted . There are heaps of yellowed euros and deutschmarks dumped here , like snowdrifts . Wood panel , marble . Silence . And the air is strangely clear . You realize : no mites . The city has no eyes or ears here . You walk through empty , miteless rooms , stepping around light fixtures . Then she ’s there , in a doorway . Her eyes , bright blue , radiant . Her smile , with that chaste yellow dress , so bashful . She comes to you . “ You want it ? ” she says . “ You want to be infected ? You want to fly ? ” You nod . Eyes closing , she leans in for the kiss .</body>
