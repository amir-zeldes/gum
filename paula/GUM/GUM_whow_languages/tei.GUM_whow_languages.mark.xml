		<!--Name your language . This is the most fundamental property in all languages . You have many names to choose from . You can even use a made up word from your made up language like ' Victory ' or ' Great Language ' . The choice is all yours . Start off with the highly frequently used words such as ' and ' or ' I ' or ' one ' or ' the ' . It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used . An example would be ' ant ' for and or ' es ' or even ' loo ' for the word ' and ' . Start thinking about the grammar rules . For example if the word Bird is ' Vogelaviatiolap ' then why not make the word Birds ' Vogelaviatiolaps ' since the suffix ' s ' is added at the end for most languages at plurals . If you want to add complication , you can add genders like most European languages like French and German . For example , if you want the word ' horse ' to be a boy , you may want ' the horse ' to be ' Mat Fereder ' , but a ' cat ' to be a girl , you may want , ' the cat ' to be ' Fet Kamaow ' . Consider basing your language on an existing language . For example , in my made up language , ' Vogelaviatiolap ' means Bird . If you have n't guessed , it comes from the following : ' Vogel ' comes from German , which means bird ' aviatio ' comes from English . It 's uncompleted though , because the word is part of the term ' aviation ' ' lap ' comes from Onomatopoeia . It 's a completed term , but it is supposed to come from ' Flap ! ' Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented . For example , if you invented the word ' China ' as ' Khinssa ' , ' Drink ' as ' Bever ' , and the word ' Accident ' as ' Casnondelibreaten ' , why not make the word ' tea ' as ' Khincasnonbever ' or ' Bevernondelibreatekin ' or even ' Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever ' ! Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words . Why not add some non Latin Characters such as ß ? You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese ! You can even take some words of languages , altering them or not . You can make the word ' pen ' as ' penn ' or even ' pen ' . Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word . Keep track of all your Remember to write down your creations ! Use your language . Get used to using it yourself , and spread it to others . Once you feel confident about your language , experiment and expand : Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language . Teach your friends this new language . As soon as your friends understand your language , communicate to them with it . Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends , family and strangers ! Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language . If you 're really ambitious , set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language . One day , maybe you can make it the official language of a country !-->
