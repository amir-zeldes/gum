	</header><body>Tulsa Tulsa is in the Green Country region of Oklahoma . It is also called “ T-town ” by the locals and has been called the " Oil Capital of the World " . The city had about 391,000 people and the metro area had about 937,000 people as of 2010 from the US Census Bureau . The Tulsa Bartlesville Combined area had 988,000 in the 2010 census . Understand Tulsa lies in northeastern Oklahoma , at the convergence of the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau , and receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year , both of which account for its abundant beautiful rolling green terrain . As a result , Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat , arid dust bowl . Summers can be very warm and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter , but it does not last long . The winters are considered to be very mild . There is not much snow , just a few inches each year , typically , although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large " ice storms " . Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually . In Tulsa you will find old west charm as well as a cosmopolitan atmosphere . You will find the people of Tulsa love their city and they have that southern charm , so they are willing to help you find your way around . Tulsa has one of the largest concentrations of Art Deco in the nation , having been a booming city during the 1920s when the architecture was first built by rich oil barons who built stately mansions and turned the Downtown area into a treasure trove of art . Get in By plane Tulsa International Airport ( IATA : TUL ) in the northern part of Tulsa . It has major airlines with direct flights to major cities in the U.S. It is a small but nice airport with sofas and chairs all around and a very laid-back feel . The car rental area and parking is well integrated . The airport offers free short term parking ( first half-hour free ) . Richard L. Jones , Jr. Airport ( IATA : RVS ) ( often called the " Riverside Airport " ) is south of downtown and is a general aviation airport . By train There is no passenger train service to Tulsa . By car Most Tulsans drive almost everywhere , although bus , bike , and pedestrian routes are starting to catch on . From the North / Kansas - US-75 South from Bartlesville , OK , or US-169 South from Coffeyville , KS . From the Northeast / Missouri - I-44 West , aka the " Will Rogers Turnpike . " The world 's former largest McDonalds spans the roadway near Vinita , OK . From the East / Arkansas - US-412 West , aka the " Cherokee Turnpike . " From the Southeast / Arkansas - The " Muskogee Turnpike . " From the South - US-75 from Okmulgee , OK , aka the " Okmulgee Beeline . " From the Southwest / Oklahoma City - I-44 East , aka the " Turner Turnpike . " From the West - US-412 East , aka the " Cimarron Turnpike . " For the slow scenic route from Northeast or Southwest come in on old Route 66 . By bus Greyhound Bus Lines +1918584-4428 , 317 S Detroit Ave. ( downtown ) . Get around Thanks to urban planning , the major city streets are placed in a grid layout . Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other , and exactly in a straight line . That makes it much easier to find places than in cities where streets go every which way . The major exception is downtown , which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid . By car Several freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area : I-244 , I-44 , US 169 ( Mingo Valley Expressway , aka " Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway " ) , US 75 , Hwy 51 ( Broken Arrow Expressway , The " B.A. " ) , Creek Turnpike . The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system , with the main arterials running on each mile . In the core of the city , named avenues run north / south and are named after US cities , generally in repeating alphabetical order ( for example , Winston - Yale - Allegheny - Braden ) . In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns . North / South is divided by Admiral Blvd . Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River , vice versa for name streets west of Main . In the parts of the city farther from downtown , north-south streets are numbered . It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is North / South 145th East / West Avenue . Numbered streets run East / West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line . Watch out for Place , Street , Avenue designation , e.g. 47th Place , 47th Street , or Florence Place , Florence Avenue . It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is West / East 71st Street North / South . In some parts of the city , numbered streets intersect , so the distinction is important . Although rare , one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south . Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks . When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat , the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass . Thus the " twisted " area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907 . By bus Tulsa Transit provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area . Cities served are Tulsa , Sand Springs , Sapulpa , Jenks , and Broken Arrow . The central station is at 319 S. Denver ( downtown ) . They do not run that often , especially to the outer towns like Broken Arrow . Unlike major cities in the Northeast , the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city . It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle . By bicycle Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system . Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs . The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs . The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook . The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus . Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa 's rolling land to be a bit more challenging , particularly during the heat of summer . If you are looking for a good workout , the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land 's original contours . Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route . Four bike loan depots , located along Rivertrail , allow riders to borrow a bike for free for up to twenty-four hours . Tulsa has an active bicycling community .</body>
