<body>York York is an ancient cathedral city with a history that dates back to before Roman times . It is situated in Yorkshire , North Yorkshire , England with some of the best preserved historical buildings and structures in Europe . As of the 2001 census , the population of York was 181,000 . York is frequently ranked ( often vying with Manchester ) the second most visited city in England after London . York Minster Understand York was known as Eboracum by the Romans , who founded the fortress city on the River Ouse in the year 71 . York was home first to the Ninth Legion and later the Sixth . York quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain , and after 211 became the capital of the province Britannia Inferior . Constantine the Great - later responsible for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire - was first proclaimed Emperor in the city . Captured by the Vikings 866 , the city quickly took on a new identity as Jorvik ( pronounced &quot; Yor-vik &quot; ) and experienced a major urban revival as a centre of Viking trade and settlement in northern England . The Coppergate excavations of the 1970s revealed much of this Viking past . York is a fairly small city - four days is enough to see the major sights although York is a city that reveals its charms to explorers with curiosity and patience . York is known as England &apos;s &quot; City of Festivals &quot; as there are regular cultural festivals every year . The official festivals are the Viking Festival , the Festival of Angels , Early Music , Late Music , Horse Racing ( the &quot; Ebor Race Meeting &quot; ) , Multicultural Food and Arts , Chinese New Year , Mystery Plays , Christmas St Nicholas &apos; Fair , and the Food and Drink Festival . It &apos;s a romantic city for a weekend break . York is full of magic and a wonderful place to bring children ! Get in Most travellers will arrive in York by road ( car or bus ) or rail from other parts of the UK or an airport . By car Although York is not directly on any of the main north-south motorways , the connections are reasonably good . From the south , the quickest route is probably to take the M1 northbound to junction 32 , then the M18 eastbound to junction 2 , the A1M northbound to junction 44 and finally the A64 eastbound to the York Outer Ring Road ( A1237 ) . Alternatively , you can take the M1 all the way to the A64 , but the upper reaches of the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds can get very congested , especially in the rush hours . From the west , the A59 and the M62 provide connections from Liverpool and Manchester , and from the north the A1 and the A19 link York with Tyneside , Northumberland and south-eastern Scotland . Driving into the city centre itself is something to avoid . Traffic congestion on the main arterial roads serving the city ( especially the A19 on Bootham and the Inner Ring Road ) can get very bad , especially during the rush hours and on Saturday mornings . The remodelling of some roads near bottleneck junctions to accommodate bicycle lanes has made traffic jams even worse still in recent years , and parking in the city centre is very expensive . If you are just visiting York for the day , using a Park and Ride [ 1 ] costs a lot less than trying to park in or near the city centre , and there are five sites dotted around the Outer Ring Road . However , the last buses from the city centre leave at around 8 pm in the evenings and you are not allowed to leave your car in a Park and Ride overnight . Therefore , if you are staying overnight in York and arriving by car , make sure that your hotel offers parking before you book . If you are only visiting for the day but staying until late evening , you will need to use a city centre car park . </body>
