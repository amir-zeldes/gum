What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea ? I was amazed and really excited . I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate , because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something . The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because , given our lack of data , we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like , or what it should n't be like . There 's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015 , with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists . Are you intending to go there yourself ? I would love to . But I am also happy to not go , as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf ! What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways , but it does n't require me to be there . Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones , ship time is expensive , especially in Antarctica , and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there , they should have priority to be there . These animals are shrouded in mystery . Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical ; do they produce some kind of antifreeze , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own ? Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand . The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin ( a kind of formaldehyde solution ) . The formalin is great for preserving structures , but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body . This means we ca n't look at the issue you raise with these animals . What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is , so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g. , the genome , transcriptome , or metabolome , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves , we can make precise comparisons , and figure out what these animals have or do ( metabolically or chemically ) that lets them live where they live . Just knowing a whole lot about a single species is n't very useful , even if that animal is as special as these clearly are - we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way . The only way to get at what 's different is to make comparisons with close relatives . We can start that side of the work now , anticipating having more beasts in the future . In terms of their glow , I suspect that it 's not theirs - although luminescence is common in anemone relatives , they do n't usually make light themselves . They do make a host of florescent proteins , and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow . What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used ? I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization ( magnification of 60 X ) . I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome , mounted the slices on microscope slides , stained the slices to enhance contrast , and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope ( that 's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper ) . I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules ( = nematocysts ) . I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group . This step seems trivial , but it is really the most important part ! By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found , I figured out what group it belongs to , and was able to determine that within that group , it was a new species . It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication , why did it take so long ? You mean , how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly , right ? :) It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out . Some of that time was just lost time - I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish . Once we figured out what it was , we played a lot of manuscript email tag , which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel , field work , etc. Manuscript review and processing took about four months . What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used , and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA ? The preservation was not unorthodox - they followed best practices for anatomical preservation . Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes , or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold . I am curious about the population structure of the " fields " of anemones - the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually , and it 's possible that the fields are " clones " produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction . DNA is the only way to test this . This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic , and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station image : Daily et al.
