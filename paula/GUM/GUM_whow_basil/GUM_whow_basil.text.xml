Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried , it actually tastes different , almost as if it were not the same herb . This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil . Method 1 of 3 : Starting Seeds 1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow . Basil comes in many different varieties , each of which have a unique flavor and smell . Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you , then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store . Here are a few ideas : Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice , and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers . Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit , and smells very lemony . Purple basil is often grown for decoration , as well as its scent and flowers . There are perennial basils which come back year after year , like African Blue Basil ( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves ) and Thai Basil , while most other varieties are annuals , which you 'll have to plant year after year . Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow , but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained . 2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost . Basil needs warm air and sun to do well , so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost . If you live in a hot climate , you can start the seeds outside instead . To figure out when the last frost will be , consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area . 3 Prepare seed containers . Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat . Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets . Dampen the mixture with water so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate . 4 Plant the seeds . Drop one to two seeds into each container . Cover them lightly with soil . Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap , so they stay moist . Leave the containers in a sunny window . Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water . 5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge . When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil , it 's time to remove the plastic wrap . Keep watering the sprouts twice daily , never letting the soil dry out . When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature , it 's time to transplant them to a larger container . Method 2 of 3 : Caring for Basil 1 Transplant the basil plants . Once two sets of leaves have formed , basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers . Basil does not tolerate frost so do n't plant too early . It 's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil . To plant the basil in the garden , dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart . Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems . Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets . If you want to plant the basil in a container , make sure it 's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing ; they need to be planted 6 inches apart , since they grow quite large . 2 Keep the soil damp , but not soaked . Basil does best in well-drained soil , and should not be subjected to standing water . Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning , so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight . 3 Pinch off flower heads . When you see flower buds , pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off . Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves , as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows . This is called " bolting " and is more likely to happen when there 's extra sunshine . You 'll notice that if you leave the flowers , the plant will become lanky and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty . 4 Watch for pests and mold . Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand . If your plants show signs of mold growth , they may not be getting adequate sunlight , or they may be too close together . Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space . Method 3 of 3 : Harvesting and Using Basil 1 Harvest and prune . As the plant matures , pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height . If you look closely , at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off . Cut close to those tiny leaves , but be sure not to damage them . Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves . This helps the plants grow bushy . Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem , or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy . You want them to get bushy , so pinch from the top . 2 Enjoy the basil fresh . Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese . 3 Store the basil in the refrigerator . You 'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh , so plan on storing some in the fridge . Wash the leaves , dry them well , and wrap them in paper towels . Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid . 4 Freeze the basil . Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well , but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months . Place the basil in a blender with a little water . Puree it until smooth , then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it .</body>
