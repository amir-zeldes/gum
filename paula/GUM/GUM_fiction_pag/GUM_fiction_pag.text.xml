Not with the scramblers or Rorschach , not with Big Ben or Theseus or the vampires . Most people would say it started with the Fireflies , but they 'd be wrong . It ended with all those things . For me , it began with Robert Paglino . At the age of eight , he was my best and only friend . We were fellow outcasts , bound by complementary misfortune . Mine was developmental . His was genetic : an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed to nearsightedness , acne , and ( as it later turned out ) a susceptibility to narcotics . His parents had never had him optimized . Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also held that one should n't try to improve upon His handiwork . So although both of us could have been repaired , only one of us had been . I arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for some half-dozen kids , those lucky few in front punching him in the head , the others making do with taunts of mongrel and polly while waiting their turn . I watched him raise his arms , almost hesitantly , to ward off the worst of the blows . I could see into his head better than I could see into my own ; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back , that they 'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more . Even then , at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone , I was becoming a superlative observer . But I did n't know what to do . I had n't seen much of Pag lately . I was pretty sure he 'd been avoiding me . Still , when your best friend 's in trouble you help out , right ? Even if the odds are impossible — and how many eight-year-olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox buddy ? — at least you call for backup . Flag a sentry . Something . I just stood there . I did n't even especially want to help him . That did n't make sense . Even if he had n't been my best friend , I should at least have empathized . I 'd suffered less than Pag in the way of overt violence ; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a distance , scared them even as they incapacitated me . Still . I was no stranger to the taunts and insults , or the foot that appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B . I knew how that felt . Or I had , once . But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring . I was still working up the algorithms to get it back , still learning by observation . Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their midst . Every child knows that much instinctively . Maybe I should just let that process unfold , maybe I should n't try to mess with nature . Then again , Pag 's parents had n't messed with nature , and look what it got them : a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs . In the end , propaganda worked where empathy failed . Back then I did n't so much think as observe , did n't deduce so much as remember — and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog . So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag 's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game . A third , turning to face the new threat , took a blow to the face that audibly crunched the bones of his cheek . I remember wondering why I did n't take any satisfaction from that sound , why it meant nothing beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about . The rest of them ran at the sight of blood . One of the braver promised me I was dead , shouted " Fucking zombie ! " over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner . Three decades it took , to see the irony in that remark . Two of the enemy twitched at my feet . I kicked one in the head until it stopped moving , turned to the other . Something grabbed my arm and I swung without thinking , without looking until Pag yelped and ducked out of reach . " Oh , " I said . " Sorry . " One thing lay motionless . The other moaned and held its head and curled up in a ball . " Oh shit , " Pag panted . Blood coursed unheeded from his nose and splattered down his shirt . His cheek was turning blue and yellow . " Oh shit oh shit oh shit ... " I thought of something to say . " You all right ? " " Oh shit , you — I mean , you never ... " He wiped his mouth . Blood smeared the back of his hand . " Oh man are we in trouble . " " They started it . " " Yeah , but you — I mean , look at them ! " The moaning thing was crawling away on all fours . I wondered how long it would be before it found reinforcements . I wondered if I should kill it before then . " You 'd a never done that before , " Pag said . Before the operation , he meant . I actually did feel something then — faint , distant , but unmistakable . I felt angry . " They started — " Pag backed away , eyes wide . " What are you doing ? Put that down ! " I 'd raised my fists . I did n't remember doing that . I unclenched them . It took a while . I had to look at my hands very hard for a long , long time . The rock dropped to the ground , blood-slick and glistening . " I was trying to help . " I did n't understand why he could n't see that . " You 're , you 're not the same , " Pag said from a safe distance . " You 're not even Siri any more . " " I am too . Do n't be a fuckwad . " " They cut out your brain ! " " Only half . For the ep — " " I know for the epilepsy ! You think I do n't know ? But you were in that half — or , like , part of you was ... " He struggled with the words , with the concept behind them . " And now you 're different . It 's like , your mom and dad murdered you — " " My mom and dad , " I said , suddenly quiet , " saved my life . I would have died . " " I think you did die , " said my best and only friend . " I think Siri died , they scooped him out and threw him away and you 're some whole other kid that just , just grew back out of what was left . You 're not the same . Ever since . You 're not the same . "</body>
