<body>The Chatham Islands The Chatnam Islands ( Rekohu in the indigenous Moriori language ) are the eastern-most settled islands in New Zealand . The islands are in their own time zone , 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time ; the International Date Line jogs eastward to keep them on the same calendar day as the rest of New Zealand . The islands lie 860 km east of Christchurch , in the middle of the &quot; Roaring Forties &quot; . Steeped in culture and history , these islands are on the very edge of civilisation . Experience Moriori culture , experience Rekohu . Understand The Chatham Islands consist of the main island , Chatham Island itself , with a population of 600 , smaller Pitt Island with about 40 inhabitants , and a number of rocky outcrops . The islands are volcanic in origin and have a unique and sensitive habitat that supports many rare and endangered species . The original people of the islands are the Moriori , who were descended from the Maori of mainland New Zealand , but who developed their own culture and variant of the language . In 1835 Maori settlers from the mainland arrived , massacred and enslaved the Moriori . Get in By plane The only way for visitors to travel to the Chathams is via scheduled or chartered air service . Air Chathams fly 5 days per week , from either Christchurch , Auckland or Wellington and , seasonally , from Napier . The plane is based in the Chathams and flies to mainland New Zealand in the morning , then back to the Chathams in the afternoon . As part of New Zealand , there are no passport or visa requirements and no border controls on arrival from the mainland . You should book or ensure accommodation before you board a flight for the Chathams , as during the popular months of the tourism season , between October and April , accommodation can be severely limited . There are no same-day return flights , so once there you have to stay at least one night . Although flying to the Chathams and back is not cheap , it is worth it . Even the mainland school groups that fly there for school camps , and choose to stay at Kopinga Marae [ 1 ] get value for money by chartering a flight one way . Anyway , you do n&apos;t have a choice on how you get there , unless you happen to own an aeroplane . However , when you get off that aeroplane , if you have n&apos;t pre-organised transport , you will have to walk , and it is a long way into town . By boat The only scheduled shipping service to the Chatham Islands remains the Black Robin Freighters &quot; Rangatira &quot; , an antiquated , slow and small coastal trading vessel . This boat has serviced the islands for many years , but does not carry passengers . Freight charges on the Rangatira appear to be flexible and subject to change . Vessels can call at the Chathams and there are a number of &quot; safe &quot; harbours for shelter if the need arises . Remember to notify the local policeman , or Ministry of Fisheries officer if you are entering New Zealand via the Chathams . If you want a wharf berthage then call the local harbour master as you near the Chathams and he will sort you out . Get around There are several businesses on Chatham Island that will rent you a vehicle . Do not expect the flashest and latest in rental cars though . The cars &quot; will &quot; be warranted and safe , but they wo n&apos;t be exceptionally &quot; flash &quot; . Chatham Motors have a range of nice rental vans available as well and they provide pretty good service for both visitors and locals . See Basalt columns Some of the world &apos;s most rare and endangered birds , plants and insects . Unique tree carvings done by the peaceful Moriori people hundreds of years ago . Henga Scenic Reserve . Set adjacent to Henga Lodge is the magnificent Henga Scenic Reserve . Guests of the lodge can meander around either a short easy walk , or take the longer 2 hr return walk out onto the spectacular beach . Access is free to Lodge guests . Hapupu National Historic Scenic Reserve . One of only two National Historic Scenic Reserves in New Zealand ( the other is the Waitangi Treaty Grounds ) , Hapupu is a special place , and somewhere that you will want to tell others about . Spiritually and culturally important to Moriori , it holds the last known concentration of momori-rakau , or tree carvings done by the ancestors of today &apos;s Moriori . There are many views on why they did these carvings , but whatever the reason , you will find them a very special attraction . Port Hutt . One of the most scenicly attractive ports in the whole of New Zealand , Port Hutt boasts an incredibly sheltered little harbour , with picturesque views and safe anchorage in all weather . Historically important and economically crucial for these islands today , Port Hutt is the ideal location for a short browse around and a mecca for those photography buffs [ 2 ] . Kopinga Marae . If you could define a place that will remind you of your visit to the Chathams , then this very special place will be at the top of your list . Opened in 2005 , Kopinga is the official meeting place of Te Imi Moriori . Adorned with contemporary Moriori carvings and traditional taonga ( treasures ) , the marae is a magnificent , tasteful and contemporary testament to the ancestors of Te Imi Moriori . Enjoy a guided tour of this beautiful and peaceful building . School-Camps At Kopinga Marae [ 3 ] also utilise this wonderful national treasure for hosting visiting school groups . Tommy Solomon Statue . Tame Horomona Rehe was the last known full-blooded Moriori and he passed away in 1933 . He was however , not the last Moriori . His own descendants and the descendants of other Moriori live on today . Come and have a look at this statue , erected in 1985 to commemorate his passing . Come and see Manakau , the property of his descendants , located on the eastern corner of Rekohu and blessed with the sun &apos;s first rays as they rise above the sea each day . </body>
