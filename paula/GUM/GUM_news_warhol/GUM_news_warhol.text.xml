Evansville , Indiana , United States - This past week marked the opening night of an Andy Warhol exhibit at the University of Southern Indiana . USI 's art gallery , like 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country , is a recipient of a major Warhol donor program , and this program is cultivating new interest in Warhol 's photographic legacy . Wikinews reporters attended the opening and spoke to donors , exhibit organizers and patrons . The USI art gallery celebrated the Thursday opening with its display of Warhol 's Polaroids , gelatin silver prints and several colored screen prints . USI 's exhibit , which is located in Evansville , Indiana , is to run from January 23 through March 9 . Full interview with Kristin Wilkins , curator of the exhibition at the University of Southern Indiana . Audio : Jkthom . The McCutchan Art Center / Pace Galleries at USI bases its exhibit around roughly 100 Polaroids selected from its collection . The Polaroids were all donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program , according to Kristen Wilkins , assistant professor of photography and curator of the exhibit . The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts made two donations to USI Art Collections , in 2007 and a second recently . Kathryn Waters , director of the gallery , expressed interest in further donations from the foundation in the future . Since 2007 the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program has seeded university art galleries throughout the United States with over 28,000 Andy Warhol photographs and other artifacts . The program takes a decentralized approach to Warhol 's photography collection and encourages university art galleries to regularly disseminate and educate audiences about Warhol 's artistic vision , especially in the area of photography .

Wilkins observed that the 2007 starting date of the donation program , which is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts , coincided with the 20th anniversary of Andy Warhol 's death in 1987 . USI was not alone in receiving a donation . K.C. Maurer , chief financial officer and treasurer at the Andy Warhol Foundation , said 500 institutions received the initial invitation and currently 190 universities have accepted one or more donations . Institutional recipients , said Mauer , are required to exhibit their donated Warhol photographs every ten years as one stipulation . While USI is holding its exhibit , there are also Warhol Polaroid exhibits at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs , New York and an Edward Steichen and Andy Warhol exhibit at the Mary &amp; Leigh Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois . All have received Polaroids from the foundation . University exhibits can reach out and attract large audiences . For example , the Weatherspoon Art Museum at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro saw attendance levels reach 11,000 visitors when it exhibited its Warhol collection in 2010 , according to curator Elaine Gustafon . That exhibit was part of a collaboration combining the collections from Duke University , located in Durham , North Carolina , and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , which also were recipients of donated items from the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program . Superstars Each collection donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program holds Polaroids of well-known celebrities . The successful UNC Greensboro exhibit included Polaroids of author Truman Capote and singer-songwriter Carly Simon . " I think America 's obsession with celebrity culture is as strong today as it was when Warhol was living " , said Gustafon . " People are still intrigued by how stars live , dress and socialize , since it is so different from most people 's every day lives . " Wilkins explained Warhol 's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life . " He 's hanging out with the celebrities , and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career " , Wilkins said . The exhibit at USI includes Polaroids of actor Dennis Hopper ; musician Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran ; publishers Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone Magazine and Carlo De Benedetti of Italy 's la Repubblica ; disco club owner Steve Rubell of Studio 54 ; photographers Nat Finkelstein , Christopher Makos and Felice Quinto ; and athletes Vitas Gerulaitis ( tennis ) and Jack Nicklaus ( golf ) . Wikinews observed the USI exhibit identifies and features Polaroids of fashion designer Halston , a former resident of Evansville . University collections across the United States also include Polaroids of " unknowns " who have not yet had their fifteen minutes of fame . Cynthia Thompson , curator and director of exhibits at the University of Arkansas , Fayetteville , said , " These images serve as documentation of people in his every day life and art - one which many of us enjoy a glimpse into . " Warhol 's photographic legacy Warhol was close to important touchstones of the 1960s , including art , music , consumer culture , fashion , and celebrity worship , which were all buzzwords and images Wikinews observed at USI 's opening exhibit . He was also an influential figure in the pop art movement . " Pop art was about what popular American culture really thought was important " , Kathryn Waters said . " That 's why he did the Campbell Soup cans or the Marilyn pictures , these iconic products of American culture whether they be in film , video or actually products we consumed . So even back in the sixties , he was very aware of this part of our culture . Which as we all know in 2014 , has only increased probably a thousand fold . " " I think everybody knows Andy Warhol 's name , even non-art people , that 's a name they might know because he was such a personality " , Water said . Hilary Braysmith , USI associate professor of art history , said , " I think his photography is equally influential as his graphic works , his more famous pictures of Marilyn . In terms of the evolution of photography and experimentation , like painting on them or the celebrity fascination , I think he was really ground-breaking in that regard . " The Polaroid format is not what made Warhol famous , however , he is in the company of other well-known photographers who used the camera , such as Ansel Adams , Chuck Close , Walker Evans , Robert Mapplethorpe , and Helmut Newton . Wilkins said , " [ Warhol ] liked the way photo booths and the Polaroid 's front flash looked " . She explained how Warhol 's adoption of the Polaroid camera revealed his process . According to Wilkins , Warhol was able to reproduce the Polaroid photograph and create an enlargement of it , which he then could use to commit the image to the silk screen medium by applying paint or manipulating them further . One of the silk screens exhibited at USI this time was the Annie Oakley screen print called " Cowboys and Indians " from 1987 . Wilkins also said Warhol was both an artist and a businessperson . " As a way to commercialize his work , he would make a blue Marilyn and a pink Marilyn and a yellow Marilyn , and then you could pick your favorite color and buy that . It was a very practical salesman approach to his work . He was very prolific but very business minded about that . " " He wanted to be rich and famous and he made lots of choices to go that way " , Wilkins said . USI exhibit Kiara Perkins , a second year USI art major , admitted she was willing to skip class Thursday night to attend the opening exhibit but then circumstances allowed for her to attend the exhibit . Why did she so badly want to attend ? " It 's Warhol . He is a legend . " For Kevin Allton , a USI instructor in English , Warhol was also a legend . He said , " Andy Warhol was the center of the Zeitgeist for the 20th century and everything since . He is a post-modern diety . " Allton said he had only seen the Silver Clouds installation before in film . The Silver Clouds installation were silver balloons blown up with helium , and those balloons filled one of the smaller rooms in the gallery . " I thought that in real life it was really kind of magical , " Allton said . " I smacked them around . " Elements of the Zeitgeist were also playfully recreated on USI 's opening night . In her opening remarks for attendees , Waters pointed out those features to attendees , noting the touches of the Warhol Factory , or the studio where he worked , that were present around them . She pointed to the refreshment table with Campbell 's Soup served with " electric " Kool Aid and tables adorned with colorful gumball " pills " . The music in the background was from such bands as The Velvet Underground . The big hit of the evening , Wikinews observed from the long line , was the Polaroid-room where attendees could wear a Warhol-like wig or don crazy glasses and have their own Polaroid taken . The Polaroids were ready in an instant and immediately displayed at the entry of the exhibit . Exhibit goers then became part of the very exhibit they had wanted to attend . In fact , many people Wikinews observed took out their mobiles as they left for the evening and used their own phone cameras to make one further record of the moment - a photo of a photo . Perhaps they had learned an important lesson from the Warhol exhibit that cultural events like these were ripe for use and reuse . We might even call these exit instant snap shots , the self selfie .</body>
