Crossing between the genres of science fiction , horror , anime , fantasy and comics , the event sprawled throughout all corners of the facility . Hundreds of vendors offered products new and old , joined by celebrity guests like Stan Lee , Mark Hamill , and Margaret Atwood . Various local fan organizations were there in a charitable capacity , and thousands of fans donned costumes , many of which they themselves created . Atwood , a Booker Prize-winner , was there to launch her graphic novel Angel Catbird , with illustrator Johnnie Christmas . Lee was making his final Canadian convention appearance , part of a larger farewell tour . Hamill 's schedule included a panel with Kevin Conroy , the voice of Batman in Batman : The Animated Series , in which the Star Wars lead played the Joker . Ubisoft , Microsoft , and PlayStation VR all had large areas set up for attendees to try their latest games . In the 20-minute PlayStation VR demonstration of Batman : Arkham VR , players are dropped down a secret elevator in Bruce Wayne 's manor , to the Bat Cave , to suit up . From there , the demonstration took players to investigate the murder of Nightwing . The Northern Arena Esports Championship ran throughout the weekend , facing off teams of video gamers in a packed hall . Even in early rounds , the event was well attended , with the stands full of gamers , watching the matches with live colour commentary . The finals saw US team Cloud9 and Immortals , from Brazil , face off in Counter-Strike : Global Offensive . Both unbeaten teams going in , the Brazillian team won the championship and $ 50,000 . Gameplay was delayed during the " third map " ( third round ) of the finals , when one Immortals player was caught with their headset off . After nearly half an hour , the team was deducted a point , leading to a sudden but temporary rush of success by the US team . Playstation VR demo Image : Nick Moreau .

The thousands of cosplay outfits on parade around the various halls offered a tremendous cross-section of genres and eras of pop culture . The majority of outfits involved at least some elements made from scratch , a fantastic display of craftsmanship . Of the thousands , Wikinews spoke with a cosplayer going by the name " The Katherinator " . She was outside the building in the gardens , waiting for a photographer she had arranged to shoot her new Epic Mickey costumed character-style outfit . With shoes as wide as a forearm , and a rigid torso of carved foam , she remained exuberant even when caught in the traffic between halls , many hours into wearing the outfit .
